If you plan on using this on Verizon Wifi calling will be unavailable. Second, if you drop signal the phone doesn't automatically reconnect when you are back in the service area. You will either have to restart the phone or enter airplane mode for 8 seconds. It's annoying. If you are on any other network, I highly recommend this phone. The camera is fantastic. It's fast.

       "884  \\nI purchased this phone in December of last year. Everything was working fine. The camera is great, the processor is very fast, watching video was no problem and the phone clarity was perfect. The rugged design is exactly as promised, quite durable.However, a few days ago, when I got up from bed, it dropped from bed, on a THICK, CARPETED floor, not even a few feet. I plugged it in, but the screen WILL NOT turn on.- rebooting, didn't work.- charging all night, didn't work- plugging into the computer, didn't workNOTHING WORKSThe pic included is what happens when you plug it it: NOTHING.I am a fair person, so until the manufacturer honors the warranty, it'll have to stay at the 1-star rating. This is only a 3 MONTH old phone, so contact me asap.\\n"

    "N-grams are the combination of multiple words used together. Ngrams with N=1 are called unigrams. Similarly, bigrams (N=2), trigrams (N=3) and so on can also be used.\n",
    "Unigrams do not usually contain as much information as compared to bigrams and trigrams. The basic principle behind n-grams is that they capture the language structure, like what letter or word is likely to follow the given one. The longer the n-gram (the higher the n), the more context you have to work with. Optimum length really depends on the application – if your n-grams are too short, you may fail to capture important differences. On the other hand, if they are too long, you may fail to capture the “general knowledge” and only stick to particular cases."

It's not a perfect phone, but it specs deliver in the areas that matter: Excellent battery (I get 1.5 days of use before I need to charge it again) plus the charging speed is amazing, great screen quality and the performace of the processor is great. This phone with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB RAM simply rocks. Great screen resolution and smooth 120Hz that can dynamically scale down. The cameras are ok, a lot better than the ones my other phones had. Oxygen OS is ok as well, somewhat different from other experiences I've had but it's nice.The phone has some cons that to me are that important: No wireless charging (not really necessary with supervooc charging), IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0. But given the price point of this phone, this cons can be overlooked.Conclusion: It's a must get. For the money it's hard to find a better option, it cuts some corners but it's worth it\",\n",

If done again I'd likely choose black over the green.I guess charging is fast.Cons:OxygenOS is clunky, feels less stock android than I'd like. Oh yes, and launcher crashes out of box not sure what that is about.Scrolling smoothness is somehow less smooth than my 4 y/o phone, not sure if it's a refresh issue but annoying no matter.Outdoor screen brightness is quite poor compared to what I had expected. Nowhere near iPhone 13 Pro, and at times seems worse again than my 4 y/o phone.Will it meet my needs? Likely. Does it meet my expectations at this level for OnePlus? Not really.\",\n",

       " 'I tried so many phones to upgrade from my oneplus 8 pro that my brother started making fun of me.I tried Sony Xperia 4, iPhone 13, galaxy s22, and oneplus 7 pro. And I didn\\'t like ANY of them.They had better cameras for sure. Especially the iPhone was my favorite, but I hated using most of them. The s22 and pixel 7 pro were awful to hold, it felt like I held a brick all day. I use nova launcher and pie control for more efficient navigation and the pixel had issues that made it difficult to use. Oh also, the fingerprint reader was so bad and unreliable. Sony Xperia was a cool experience, but overall I didn\\'t like it, iPhone I kept and use but just as a \"pro camera\" and s22 I returned in a heartbeat.Now, the oneplus I can\\'t stop holding and using. Even before I transferred everything over and had the Sim card in, I used it just to open it and see the beautiful screen and the fluidity of the OS. The camera is OK. I\\'m a professional photographer so can be picky with pics. The iPhone 14 has a phenomenal camera, oneplus 11 has a camera that can take some great shots, just not all the time. There\\'s been some I\\'ve been surprised and impressed and others that were just mediocre. I almost got the 10 pro last year and I\\'m so glad I waited, none of them Felt right until this one. I love this phone. Beautiful screen, super fast, decent camera, OH RIGHT the charging is also insanely fast! Another great thing. I want to add, there has been some pictures that look REALLY good. Some looked like I took from my dslr, like super good, but it\\'s not all the time, the lighting has to be right(I do wish it had some features thats exclusive to the pixel tho)',\n",

I dare not use a mobile phone without a mobile phone caseð\\x9f\\x98\\x82, maybe this mobile phone brand is relatively small.Now I found a problem. Sometimes the screen will not respond. It has been several times and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know if I should return the product.',\n",
       " \"I was nervous to buy this phone on Amazon lol, but I gave in after a week of searching between OnePlus 11,s23ultra and the pixel 7pro. I had a galaxy s10, n a OnePlus 8 I hated the s10, but loved the OnePlus 8 more than any phone I've ever had!n the only reason I kept looking at the others were the camera quality everyone raved about. But in the end I gave in n chose this phone! The camera quality isn't amazing but it's not bad either. The charge holds for at least 24hrs.i had to charge my s10 every 4-6hrs n it became a hassle!! This phone is almost perfect. No portable charging which doesn't phase me since it holds a charge for a good while and charges super fast when dead!! Only complaint is the camera is say, but it gets the job done and has edits. So I say I'm in love!!! Best Amazon purchase ever!\",\n",
       " \"First impression is how beautiful the phone is. This was great because I'm not usually the kind of person who's big into the aesthetics. The only knock to that is the cameras take up such a big part of the phone and are pretty exposed. Kinda looks funky to me, but that's kinda how most phones are going. Because they are so exposed, they will definitely need extra protection there, which is difficult right now because the phone is so new and case choices are extremely limited or for preorder. This is also true at the moment for screen protectors. The weight of the phone is very pleasing as well, not too heavy but feels higher quality.The phone is obviously a beast hardware-wise and the cameras are great for a general user, but are absolutely not top of the line (but close). You can also set upto an additional 12gb of unused space for additional virtual RAM if you want even more speed.Another important thing is the phone is super slippery and hard to hold safely, especially with one hand. So again a good case will be definitely required unless you like smacking yourself in the face at night with it while lying down.Also keep in mind, no wireless charging, which isn't important for me, but if it is for you then keep that in mind. The battery otherwise it's nuts and barely moving. It charged from 20% to full before I even finished moving over my stuff from my old phone (one plus 7 lol), which btw was seamless and took about 20 minutes for ~30gb of data via the old cable.The main reason for losing two stars is that the One Plus launcher keeps freezing and locking up even after fully updating the phone and multiple restarts. Maybe I don't know the technology well, but I have to use the default system launcher and even then it's extremely buggy. The One Plus launcher still trys to turn itself on, so even though I have the other launcher set to default it breaks and freezes the whole phone every few minutes.All in all the phone is obviously still new, so we'll see how it develops. But for what you pay you get a killer phone able to compete with the big guys on *most* fronts and still save a couple hundred bucks.Assuming the UI bugs get fixed soon, I'd def give it 4.5-5 stars initially pending more usage.\",\n",
       " 'Overall I\\'m loving the OnePlus 11 so far! It really feels like a flagship device, but without the ludicrous flagship price tag. It\\'s not a perfect phone, but delivers on the aspects that matter most to me: Performance, screen quality, and battery life + charging speed. The phone doesn\\'t skip a beat with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and up to a whopping 16GB RAM. Gorgeous screen with 1440p resolution and buttery 120Hz that dynamically scales down to save battery. Speaking of which, the battery experience is wonderful. I\\'m seeing 1.5-2 days of regular use before needing to charge back up, which takes less than 30 mins!The phone does have some shortcomings however: No wireless charging, IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0, decent cameras that are overshadowed by the competition, and finally a very different UI experience compared to OxygenOS of the past. These are all sacrifices that I\\'m willing to make given the price point of the phone.Conclusion: It\\'s a well rounded flagship level phone that makes smart compromises in order to justify a more reasonable price. For the money it\\'s hard to find a better value in terms of sheer hardware specs than the OnePlus 11. Although not quite the \"flagship killer\" we used to know, this showing is certainly a step in the right direction.',\n",
       " \"Love my OnePlus 11 so much!!  You will not be disappointed.  The haptics are amazing, the performance is fast and fluid, especially for gaming.  The camera takes stunning photos, especially portraits which I take a lot of with family and pets (see example taken of my cat).  Night photography really captures details and the video recording is beautiful.  It doesn't get the credit it deserves in terms of camera as it revivalswhat  the best phones have to offer.  Yeah, no wireless charging but so what?  The battery life gets you way more than through the day (I'd like to see the Pixel 7 Pro say that) and to charge the phone all the way in 25 minutes is game changing.  A lot of people also through shade at OxygenOS being ColorOS but honestly, I love it.  So many nice features and customization that the hate it receives is completely unjust.For the price point and all that you get with this device, it simply can't be beat!!\"]"

It\\'s not a perfect phone, but it specs deliver in the areas that matter: Excellent battery (I get 1.5 days of use before I need to charge it again) plus the charging speed is amazing, great screen quality and the performace of the processor is great. This phone with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB RAM simply rocks. Great screen resolution and smooth 120Hz that can dynamically scale down. The cameras are ok, a lot better than the ones my other phones had. Oxygen OS is ok as well, somewhat different from other experiences I\\'ve had but it\\'s nice.The phone has some cons that to me are that important: No wireless charging (not really necessary with supervooc charging), IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0. But given the price point of this phone, this cons can be overlooked.Conclusion: It\\'s a must get. For the money it\\'s hard to find a better option, it cuts some corners but it\\'s worth it I\\'m coming from the OnePlus 7 Pro Mclaren and wanted to leave some notes:Pros:Phone design is nice, feels good/light in hand but solid build. If done again I\\'d likely choose black over the green.I guess charging is fast.Cons:OxygenOS is clunky, feels less stock android than I\\'d like. Oh yes, and launcher crashes out of box not sure what that is about.Scrolling smoothness is somehow less smooth than my 4 y/o phone, not sure if it\\'s a refresh issue but annoying no matter.Outdoor screen brightness is quite poor compared to what I had expected. Nowhere near iPhone 13 Pro, and at times seems worse again than my 4 y/o phone.Will it meet my needs? Likely. Does it meet my expectations at this level for OnePlus? Not really. El telÃ©fono es una excelente maquina, velocidad, pantalla, cÃ¡mara excelente, baterÃ\\xada, carga rÃ¡pida,DOBLE SIM Y RECIBE ESIM TAMBIÃ\\x89N, pero nada es perfecto, estando enamorado del telÃ©fono  me acuesto y olvidÃ© prender el aire acondicionado y pensÃ© voy a prenderlo con el OnePlus 11 como lo hacÃ\\xada mi xiaomi 10tpro, por ir y wala no tiene ir el one plus decepciÃ³n nÃºmero uno aunque no es muy relevante seguirÃ© haciendo updates I tried so many phones to upgrade from my oneplus 8 pro that my brother started making fun of me.I tried Sony Xperia 4, iPhone 13, galaxy s22, and oneplus 7 pro. And I didn\\'t like ANY of them.They had better cameras for sure. Especially the iPhone was my favorite, but I hated using most of them. The s22 and pixel 7 pro were awful to hold, it felt like I held a brick all day. I use nova launcher and pie control for more efficient navigation and the pixel had issues that made it difficult to use. Oh also, the fingerprint reader was so bad and unreliable. Sony Xperia was a cool experience, but overall I didn\\'t like it, iPhone I kept and use but just as a \"pro camera\" and s22 I returned in a heartbeat.Now, the oneplus I can\\'t stop holding and using. Even before I transferred everything over and had the Sim card in, I used it just to open it and see the beautiful screen and the fluidity of the OS. The camera is OK. I\\'m a professional photographer so can be picky with pics. The iPhone 14 has a phenomenal camera, oneplus 11 has a camera that can take some great shots, just not all the time. There\\'s been some I\\'ve been surprised and impressed and others that were just mediocre. I almost got the 10 pro last year and I\\'m so glad I waited, none of them Felt right until this one. I love this phone. Beautiful screen, super fast, decent camera, OH RIGHT the charging is also insanely fast! Another great thing. I want to add, there has been some pictures that look REALLY good. Some looked like I took from my dslr, like super good, but it\\'s not all the time, the lighting has to be right(I do wish it had some features thats exclusive to the pixel tho) The performance and price of the mobile phone are very good, but I just canâ\\x80\\x99t buy a mobile phone case. The online order may arrive next month. I dare not use a mobile phone without a mobile phone caseð\\x9f\\x98\\x82, maybe this mobile phone brand is relatively small.Now I found a problem. Sometimes the screen will not respond. It has been several times and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know if I should return the product. I was nervous to buy this phone on Amazon lol, but I gave in after a week of searching between OnePlus 11,s23ultra and the pixel 7pro. I had a galaxy s10, n a OnePlus 8 I hated the s10, but loved the OnePlus 8 more than any phone I\\'ve ever had!n the only reason I kept looking at the others were the camera quality everyone raved about. But in the end I gave in n chose this phone! The camera quality isn\\'t amazing but it\\'s not bad either. The charge holds for at least 24hrs.i had to charge my s10 every 4-6hrs n it became a hassle!! This phone is almost perfect. No portable charging which doesn\\'t phase me since it holds a charge for a good while and charges super fast when dead!! Only complaint is the camera is say, but it gets the job done and has edits. So I say I\\'m in love!!! Best Amazon purchase ever! First impression is how beautiful the phone is. This was great because I\\'m not usually the kind of person who\\'s big into the aesthetics. The only knock to that is the cameras take up such a big part of the phone and are pretty exposed. Kinda looks funky to me, but that\\'s kinda how most phones are going. Because they are so exposed, they will definitely need extra protection there, which is difficult right now because the phone is so new and case choices are extremely limited or for preorder. This is also true at the moment for screen protectors. The weight of the phone is very pleasing as well, not too heavy but feels higher quality.The phone is obviously a beast hardware-wise and the cameras are great for a general user, but are absolutely not top of the line (but close). You can also set upto an additional 12gb of unused space for additional virtual RAM if you want even more speed.Another important thing is the phone is super slippery and hard to hold safely, especially with one hand. So again a good case will be definitely required unless you like smacking yourself in the face at night with it while lying down.Also keep in mind, no wireless charging, which isn\\'t important for me, but if it is for you then keep that in mind. The battery otherwise it\\'s nuts and barely moving. It charged from 20% to full before I even finished moving over my stuff from my old phone (one plus 7 lol), which btw was seamless and took about 20 minutes for ~30gb of data via the old cable.The main reason for losing two stars is that the One Plus launcher keeps freezing and locking up even after fully updating the phone and multiple restarts. Maybe I don\\'t know the technology well, but I have to use the default system launcher and even then it\\'s extremely buggy. The One Plus launcher still trys to turn itself on, so even though I have the other launcher set to default it breaks and freezes the whole phone every few minutes.All in all the phone is obviously still new, so we\\'ll see how it develops. But for what you pay you get a killer phone able to compete with the big guys on *most* fronts and still save a couple hundred bucks.Assuming the UI bugs get fixed soon, I\\'d def give it 4.5-5 stars initially pending more usage. Overall I\\'m loving the OnePlus 11 so far! It really feels like a flagship device, but without the ludicrous flagship price tag. It\\'s not a perfect phone, but delivers on the aspects that matter most to me: Performance, screen quality, and battery life + charging speed. The phone doesn\\'t skip a beat with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and up to a whopping 16GB RAM. Gorgeous screen with 1440p resolution and buttery 120Hz that dynamically scales down to save battery. Speaking of which, the battery experience is wonderful. I\\'m seeing 1.5-2 days of regular use before needing to charge back up, which takes less than 30 mins!The phone does have some shortcomings however: No wireless charging, IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0, decent cameras that are overshadowed by the competition, and finally a very different UI experience compared to OxygenOS of the past. These are all sacrifices that I\\'m willing to make given the price point of the phone.Conclusion: It\\'s a well rounded flagship level phone that makes smart compromises in order to justify a more reasonable price. For the money it\\'s hard to find a better value in terms of sheer hardware specs than the OnePlus 11. Although not quite the \"flagship killer\" we used to know, this showing is certainly a step in the right direction. Love my OnePlus 11 so much!!  You will not be disappointed.  The haptics are amazing, the performance is fast and fluid, especially for gaming.  The camera takes stunning photos, especially portraits which I take a lot of with family and pets (see example taken of my cat).  Night photography really captures details and the video recording is beautiful.  It doesn\\'t get the credit it deserves in terms of camera as it revivalswhat  the best phones have to offer.  Yeah, no wireless charging but so what?  The battery life gets you way more than through the day (I\\'d like to see the Pixel 7 Pro say that) and to charge the phone all the way in 25 minutes is game changing.  A lot of people also through shade at OxygenOS being ColorOS but honestly, I love it.  So many nice features and customization that the hate it receives is completely unjust.For the price point and all that you get with this device, it simply can\\'t be beat!! I\\'ve always been a OnePlus fan. There\\'s one issue with their phones which may lead me to buy a different brand. If you plan on using this on Verizon Wifi calling will be unavailable. Second, if you drop signal the phone doesn\\'t automatically reconnect when you are back in the service area. You will either have to restart the phone or enter airplane mode for 8 seconds. It\\'s annoying. If you are on any other network, I highly recommend this phone. The camera is fantastic. It\\'s fast. The battery last all day. The 120 screen scrolls flawlessly on pages.

So many nice features and customization that the hate it receives is completely unjust.For the price point and all that you get with this device, it simply can\\'t be beat!! This is my first android phone coming from an iPhone and I have to say I am impressed. I love the screen, battery, lightness of the device, and how it feels in the hand. Also at the price it is at, it makes it a great buy if you can look past the camera flaws. However, you are not buying this phone for a camera. It has flagship specs and performance at the cost of an almost mid range device. I do run into some stutters and crashes here and there, but idk if that is carrier related. That comes to my only problem with the phone. Even though the phone is unlocked, my carrier technically doesn\\'t support it but allows it on the network. So depending whether or not this phone gets kicked off the network, it will be a winner. I did use this device on Spectrum Mobile a Verizon Premium Carrier.Edit in March 6th: ended up returning the phone. This phone is amazing and everything on paper is great about this device. However, I had too many app crashes and stutters using the device that after chats on forms and one plus\\'s Reddit they deemed my unit to be defective and recommended to return the device. Besides from that no regrets using this phone and I am sad to see it go. Still would recommend this device. Aparato premium sin pagar el precio de uno. Pantalla de excelente calidad, procesador que no me ha glitcheado en ningÃºn momento de uso, buen sonido y una cÃ¡mara sobre el standard.El software no es el mismo que los tiempos gloriosos de OnePlus, pero es bastante amigable y customizable para que se sienta propio. Por el momento he recibido 2 actualizaciones y no he tenido ningÃºn inconveniente.OnePlus estÃ¡ de camino a su orÃ\\xadgenes! The phone is pretty awesome. The UI is pretty similar to my previous phone, Pixel 3. So the transfer wasn\\'t too bad. I really love the gaming features, in allowing you to control how to optimize your gaming sessions. Plus an FPS counter, CPU and GPU as well as a Temperature. One feature that I will miss or havent found yet, is to automatically change my phone to ring/vibrate when I\\'m using a certain device or on a certain Wifi. It\\'s a feature in Pixel 3 and have not found in OnePlus.Also looking for a case that feels like the back of this phone. The back feels so nice that I want that as a case. Too bad the sides of the phone is smooth and can be slippery as per usually, this kinda force me to find a case, which mine didn\\'t come until a few days after I got this phone.. Delivered 1 hour ago, 1st thing I did, I inserted 1 Verizon sim and 1 Straight Talk on Verizon Sim, and all works without any APN settings! So, it\\'s a keeper! Now I\\'m fixing to set it up!*UPDATE* 2 Days in, and this one is a beast! Signals are full, more than my Pixel 7 pro on T-Mobile, OnePlus 11 gets a full 5g bar signal, all the apps I put on are performing and flowing! To the reviewer that complain about the USB 2.0 instead of 3.0, is nothing wrong with it, plus in the box is a huge 80wats charger that can juice up a laptops or Chromebook super fast, it\\'s not big deal if the cable is not USB C to USB C, it\\'s a normal USB (2.0) to USB C ( 3.0) you\\'ll be dumb if you have to turn this phone for this simple fact! Plus, the wireless charging, how many really use it? Let\\'s be real! Anyway, the pictures, are better than my Pixel 7 pro! Way better! Not a perfect camera phone but not even Sony Experia has it so perfect! As a wrap, it\\'s the perfect phone, battery is well over a full day! Charges super quick! Dual stand by SIM cards ( yes Verizon on 5g too) and 256gb with 16gb RAM?! My Pixel 7 pro came with a 12gb ram and 128gb rom, at a price about 300 more dollars than OnePlus 11 5g! Folks, this is a beast! If you want a top of the line Android based phone without having to take it a loan or be in a payment plan, this is it. Oneplus makes flagship level phones for around half the money. Great features, not a ton of bloatware preinstalled. Crazy battery life and super fast charging! Great screen and plenty of memory. I\\'m not going to get all technical because, nobody really reads all that. Trust me. This is worth it! I\\'ve had the device for about a day and I can say for $700 there\\'s very little to complain about in my opinion. The 80w charging and performance alone make this device worth it. I\\'m not big on cameras in general but to me it\\'s definitely good enough for my purposes. For context I\\'m coming from a Pixel 7. I\\'ve had no issues with the interface other than the refresh rate going down to 60hz when in stuff like Google photos or certain browsers. It\\'s pretty easy to force it at 120hz. Battery is great, and even if it wasn\\'t, it takes 30 minutes to charge from 0 to 100% Received it yesterday, only 1 day experience right now. The design looks kinda strange at first glance but feel much better now. So many details make me feel surprised and comfortable. I used to be an apple fan for years and tried  S22+ last year for the first time. Can\\'t imagine the alert slider is even better than iphone. Camera is perfect for me, I love the tunning of color and night mode, plan to test portrait mode later. The OS is much better than Samsung, so far so good and haven\\'t seen the interface issue posted by some review videos. I guess my next phone will be OnePlus as well, just don\\'t want to pay $1000 for phones anymore. Received the device on 02/17 and used it during the long weekend,  it is an great phone at this price point.I purchased the 256GB varinat with 16GB RAM, it\\'s super fast when I open and switch the Apps, no lagging. Display is amazing when watch video, I like the dark mode. 5000mAh battery is big enough for support my whole day usage, and 80W is really a PLUS in experience, I am not a big fan for wireless charging, it\\'s slow and make the device hot, and they have charger in box, I no need to pay extra $$ for the fast charging. Camera meets my expectation, and better than my last device S21+.I have considered Pixel 7 Pro before buying this device, much lower price, larger RAM, fast charging makes me feel better with my choice. I do like the ergonomics,fast processor and with the  temporary memory upgrade to 256 a no brainer! Atmos sound!SuperVOOC,Fast!!!! Battery life very good.Oneplus gives you all the high end bells and whistles for a reasonable price.Iphone14 and Samsung S23 Ultra are great phones,but TOO EXPENSIVE!! The processor in this phone is very fast. Great screen view. Very nice camera, takes great photos. It\\'s easy to use, but some times the home button does not work,but you can use gestures. The main problem is not being able to tap to wake the phone. This can be a hassle. This thing literally has everything you need and everything you don\\'t. I lucked out and paid only 599.99 and got 100 amazon gc at pre-order so only $500! This thing is a battery beast and only takes about 20 min to go from 0 to 100. Wait for a sale and buy this phone if you\\'re looking for an upgrade. I have a hard time putting it down because it\\'s such a great phone. The camera isn\\'t bad! Better than my old Samsung S10e. The only thing I can see anyone complaining about is the absence of wireless charging. But this thing last all day under heavy use no problem. And it charges from 30 percent to a hundred in under 20 minutes!!!! Screen is great, gaming is better than other phones including the S23 Ultra! I have them both and the Pixel 7 pro. This is my daily driver and will be for a while if it keeps performing the way it does. The OnePlus 11 is a high powered premium phone at a mid range price. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if it becomes the best seller of all time. My purchase of the OnePlus 11 is the best decision I\\'ve ever made and I look forward to buying more OnePlus phones in the future. Did a lot of research before buying it and Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad I made the purchase! The fast charging really changed my life. I donâ\\x80\\x99t need to worry about running out of battery anymore cause I can easily charge my phone to 80% in 15 minutes. The camera is great, I usually use my DSLR camera to take photos, now with the Pro mode, I can adjust aperture, exposures etc. to take really good pictures.Highly recommended I ended up buying this phone after returning a Iphone 12, because I wasn\\'t able to get the iphone 12 activated and iphone 12 seemed a little complicated.  So i decide i\\'d never buy an iphone ever again. So i was looking at other expensive options and narrowed my choice down to Samsung or this company. I chose this company due to the cheaper price than Samsung Ultra 23.  camera seems fine.  which is one of the reasons i upgraded to an expensive phone.  i also wanted more internal storage, that\\'s another reason i purchased.  what i dont like about the cell phone and all cell phones is that when i put it in my jacket or coat pocket, the phone hurts my insides.  stomach, side, etc.  The cancer and reproductive harm risk is real.  Also when i have it in my hand a long time, i get pain as well.  due to that radiation risk, etc.  I was forced to buy a cell phone because its the way people use social media and connect, and post content, etc.  But I would prefer not to have a cell phone at all due to the cancer and reproductive harm risk, which is very clear with the pain i get when carrying it in my pocket and holding it in my hand. Excellent phone, I\\'ve only used it for a few days, but you can feel the speed and battery life.Great screen.I haven\\'t tested the camera just yet, but not my focus on a phone. The phone looks great and is fast with an amazing screen. The 11 has the newest snapdragon processor and it\\'s fast. I had a Nord N10 before which really was a great budget phone, but this 11 is really fantastic. You can also add 12GB more RAM if you have the space. I have zero regrets buying this phone! Este One plus 11 tiene todo de alta gama materiales de primera la baterÃ\\xada es muy buena dura todo el dÃ\\xada la cÃ¡mara es una delicia no hace las fotografÃ\\xadas tan electrÃ³nica como los otros Cellulares el sonido muy cristalino y potente el 5G es muy estable el procesador que traer es una bestia rÃ¡pido no calienta Excellent phone and camera. Super fast charging, battery lasts all day under heavy usage. Easy transfer of data from previous device. Simply amazing, the phone itself is very beautiful, soft touch in the back and it\\'s not a fingerprint magnetic due to its glass texture. Great grip with one hand operation.The charge speed really impressive and so the battery autonomy.A real flagship for a great price. Excellent cell phone. the problem is the wrapper is a 700 dollar product. And Amazon sends it in a super weak package and without any protection. Very happy overall, this is an absolute beast of a phone, have had about a month with no problems. I am so excited to get my hands on the OnePlus 11, especially because of its stunning red color and amazing portrait mode feature. But what really blew me away is the battery life with 5000mAh capacity. I was surprised to find out that it charges in just around 20 minutes, and then it lasts me the whole day.That\\'s so amazing!!! todo me agrado. aunque tenga doble atmos. siento carencia en calidad en audio. en todo lo demas wow. Buena inversiÃ³n I have been with OnePlus since the 3, the past 2 models were not that good, but with the OP 11 I\\'m happy to say they are back on track! OnePlus peaked around their 7 series and the last few years have been fine but inconsistent. With the 11, OnePlus is back to that winning formula. Highly recommended! This phone is Samsung worst nightmare. I don\\'t want to go into too much details just know this phone is amazing. dual sim, side rocker, the OnePlus is back This phone charges from 20% to 50% in less than 5 minutes. Title says it all....... Some apps like YouTube, Google pay, Prime Video etc.. are locked at max 60Hz refresh rate. In other apps where it actually supports 120hz refresh rate, the throttling is very agressive. This leads to a bad scrolling experience especially when compared to similar prices phones from Samsung. Having different scroll speed on different apps is very annoying and it only gets worse with time. I bought the Oneplus 11 and in the description it says compatible with Visible and Assurance Wireless, when I enter the IMEI # it is not compatible with either one, so what can I do? How do you sell a phone with such little access to accessories.  Everything is one month out :( This phone\\'s internal hardware is stellar, and the battery life is excellent. The cameras too are well done, but that\\'s where the positive ends. The software is terrible (slow, buggy, and missing helpful features that previous versions of OxygenOS had) and is just ColorOS. But perhaps worse is the hardware decision to coat the phone in a teflon-like texture (on the black model; the green model doesn\\'t have this issue.) This is without a doubt the most slippery phone I\\'ve ever held in my life â\\x80\\x93Â\\xa0it\\'s honestly somewhat impressive how slippery the phone is. Given how large, heavy, and rounded this phone is, it\\'s honestly difficult to grip without a case (and I don\\'t use cases.) I returned it as a result.Pros:- Super fast processor- Great fingerprint reader- More than adequate camera- Fantastic battery lifeCons:- Curved screen is a gimmick that makes gestures more difficult, increases glare, and increases fragility- Phone is too large and heavy- Black texture is INSANELY slippery- ColorOS simply is a bad Android skin. Old OxygenOS was way better Just that, a core function that should and would work o every high end phone is NOT working on one plus 11. I got (from OnePlus) the one with 128 GB.Big problems withh bluetooth: can\\'t find iPhone, JBL speaker, Bolttune headsets, Apple headsets, HP laptop, Nissan Murano... It finds my neighbor LG headsets and \"ktchen TV\", Lenovo laptop. Customer supplort didn\\'t help much (doing a wireless reboot and later a factory reset didn\\'t help).I returned the phone (custom support decided it\\'s a defective phone).---I got (from Amazon) the 256 GB version.Well, identical problem.I returned the phone. The worst OnePlus phone I ever owned. And I owned quite a few 6t, 7t,8 pro.Drops from Android auto all the time. Cellular network disconnects and does not come back unless you place it in/out of airplane mode. Network slowdowns -again fixed buy airplane mode trick.I will be returning it and it was my last OnePlus. Done with it. First off, I\\'m not a fan Boi, lol,well maybe a little. I\\'m 68 and retired. I\\'ve been reading phone tech sites since last century. Loved my many Microsoft phones and was disappointed when they were no longer supported. I bought a Motorola to wait it out. I\\'m no fan of IPhones, Samsung or pixles which doesn\\'t leave a lot of choices. I had been watching OnePlus for several years and grabbed the 7pro upon release in May 2019. Loved it, there was nothing I didn\\'t like about it. The pop-up selfie camera was an awesome idea and a conversation starter. Sadly it\\'s no longer supported. I knew that day would come. I kept watching OnePlus, thought about the 10 series but I decided to wait. From what I read the 11 was going to be awesome. I\\'m here to tell you it is! I got it from Best Buy just days after release. I see folks sniveling about the cases. I bought one from Amazon that has a front cover that folds over which I\\'ve never had before. I also bought one from one plus that arrived before my phone did. So stop whining about no cases they\\'re out there. I\\'m totally happy with the pictures it\\'s taking One of the things about one plus is that there\\'s no bezels. Look at your friend\\'s iPhone pictures, thick bezels on either side, Oneplus phones have nothing but a full beautiful screen for your pictures. I\\'ve only taken 1 video so far and it\\'s beautiful. I will admit I had a difficult time pairing it with my 2016 Honda CRV as it does not have Android auto which would have been easy. But I got it to work and it\\'s been working flawlessly since. For the price you\\'re not going to beat this phone from any other manufacturer. From the Snapdragon 2, which is the newest, fastest chip on the market,to all of the other internals and the low price, this phone IS the return of the OnePlus Flagship Killers. What\\'s even better is that they\\'ve decided to support the phone with 5 years of security updates and 4 years of Android goodness. Go ahead pull the trigger and grab one of these bad boys you really wont be disappointed. I bought this phone and no one is talking about how it won\\'t work on Sprint service I have call and been I store and was told this phone will not work on there network they said it will work on the T-Mobile side OnePlus 11 did it for OnePlus they are finally heading the right direction with the OnePlus 11.Finally OnePlus is listening to customers and reviewers of what we want and we need. Comes with a charger and cable 80watts it charges it in about 25 minutes 0-100%.It also comes with a good quality screen protector preinstalled. You get the full unboxing experience with OnePlus.And battery life is out of this world is just something else, It lasts all day. No need for wireless charging.For OnePlus 12 we only ask for better front facing video like 2-4K and maybe USB type C 3.0 that\\'s all that i can say is missing from this beast of a phone.But overall Love it is my favorite phone in recent years.I traded in my pixel 7 for the OnePlus 11 and don\\'t regret it one bit.Thank you OnePlus! I purchased from OnePlus but decided to leave a review here as well. It\\'s amazingly fast, nice design, nothing to not like. Some people are upset about the lack of wireless charging. I can understand being upset about that if you\\'re used to it. I\\'m coming from a Oneplus 8t so didn\\'t have it anyway. The UFS 4.0 matched with LPDDR5x RAM makes the phone very quick. The SD chipset seems to handle everything I\\'ve thrown at it so far. The screen is nice, too. It seems OnePlus has listened to their customers and sort of returned to their original high quality/low cost model that made them popular to begin with.Unrelated to the phone, but I\\'ve been seeing so many reviews in Spanish on Amazon that come from the USA. What\\'s going on with that? I work for celular carrier and I can say this is the most fast device I ever used . Performance is pretty good the phone can handle everything without problems. Definitely the design could be a little controversy because the biggest camera bump but in my case I like. Screen and sound outstanding. Cameras oh boy this is a big step compared with the OnePlus 10 pro night pictures are really good and day light awesome. Battery life is very good and charger time is a Ferrari in the Trac others phone can compete with OnePlus or Oppo in this feature. Overall is a excellent device no the best because the perfect device don\\'t exist but is a truly flagship in 2023. Don\\'t take seriously the other review writing about USB 2.0 is obviously trying to speak about negative aspects without trying the device in real life. I\\'ve used OnePlus phones in the past but stopped after OnePlus 7 due to lack of support for Verizon.All the reviews about fast charging and just the overall phone are true but I was hesitant to buy because I have Verizon.So if anybody is hesitating because they have Verizon then don\\'t because it was simple and easy to set up straight from online in my Verizon account.I just went to manage device and clicked on the swap device tab and activated the esim on the OnePlus but make sure to use IMEI 2 and visual voicemail worked and built into the dialer and wifi calling works to if you\\'re wondering. This is a known thing with OP and other brands using higher power supply feed to charge quickly. You could get USB 3 or higher speeds for moving files or drop from 80-100W charging to what you see on other brands under 30W that take 2-3X+ longer to refill.  If you want to move files then use WIFI to copy them with an app like CX Explorer. I can hit really good speeds over WIFI and the cable is only for charging.  If you want to go faster than 80W I suspect you can grab an after market charger supporting Super VOOC to hit the international charging speeds unless they locked it in the FW for the US or other than CN versions. The One Plus 11 is an outstanding value for the money! Fast and smooth interface, bright beautiful 120hz screen, and top of the line specs for a reasonable price. You will get 4 years of software support as well. I went with the 16gb model as the internal storage also gets a speed bump on this model. Well worth the money! This is a great phone for the price but you have to be smart - you can\\'t just buy and pray. Frist look up the LTE bands and how compatible is this with network. After you look that up online you need to call your carrier. Many have lists of approved phones and if it is not on their list it won\\'t work. Do your research first. Very cool phone, very beautiful, thank you OnePlus Good battery backup ( almost one charge lasts upto 36 hours)Fast charging ( with in 20 mins from 45% to 100%)Dual sim + e-sim5g phoneNice cameraI definitely recommend this phone Amazon has description that boost mobile works with this phone. it does not. tried to connect it and they said no Battery is really good First off I absolutely love this Smartphone. Performance is stellar, cameras are fantastic, Phone is beautiful, The Price is much lower than other smartphones, and offers the same features and performance. But it has a major issue that I\\'ve found. The back glass, It\\'s extremely fragile. I\\'ve had mine for 7 days with a case, and somehow it just cracked as shown in the picture. The crack is under the glass and can\\'t be felt on the outside. I\\'ve had many smartphones made of glass and never had one crack. I take extremely good care of all my devices, and all my phones live in a case 100% of the time, unless I\\'m cleaning the device. This has corning gorilla glass 5 on the back, but it spontaneously cracked. Very unhappy with this. So here\\'s my Pro\\'s and Con\\'s.Pro\\'s: Blazing Fast Performance, Excellent Battery Life, Beautiful QHD AMOLED Display, Design, Fantastic Camera, Strong Loud Stereo Speakers, Extremely Fast 80w Charging, Very Competitive Pricing, Overall Performance.Cons: Extremely Fragile Back Glass Panel.Verdict: This phone is excellent and I give the phone itself a 5 star rating, but I had to drop 3 stars for the extremely fragile, and cheap rear glass panel.P.S. OnePlus Customer Support is pretty terrible. Es compatible con metro by tmobil I was going to buy this, especially as it has the fastest cellphone processor available, then seen it only has USB 2.0, a spec from 2000 when 13 years later everyone is using USB 3.1 or 3.2 and USB 2.0 is painfully slow. I was a minute away from pulling the trigger on this phone, and I had the thought to check the reviews. At first I thought they must be wrong, what phone company uses USB-2 in the year 2023?? Well the answer is OnePlus, unfortunately.Now i\\'m back to looking for another decent phone with good battery life. This has USB 2.0! This 2023 this is embarrassing. OnePlus is horrible. Terrible service. Lo mejor de este aÃ±o por debajo de 1000 dÃ³lares no encontraras nada mejor Good Love the all-day battery life, snappy performance, wonderful haptics.The Oxygen OS is light weight and useful.Android 13 installed and 4 more updates of OS included as well as 5 years of security updates.The Snapdragon 2 processor is vastly superior to the Snapdragon 1 which should have never been marketed.A class-action lawsuit would not be surprising.  Why have a flagship phone with  3.5 hour battery life?!The camera works great except about 5% of the time as documented in many reviews.If OnePlus had put a 5x telephoto instead of the \"puny\" 2x it would have been a perfect phone.Who cares about wireless charging (it doesn\\'t have it) when it fast charges at 80 watts and has a great more than a day battery life?Oh, the other thing that would make this a perfect phone is a brighter screen for viewing outside.  I can see the screen but not as clearly as with my 1750 nits Samsung.  This is an issue using the camera and viewing photos especially.I would make this my only phone except for the screen brightness and the 2x telephoto.My other phone is a highly regarded Samsung S23 Ultra which I would return were it not for those 2 issues.As it stands I am using the Samsung outside while walking and enjoying the OnePlus the other 80% of my day.Either phone would be a great choice as your only phone.I tried the Google PIXEL 7 Pro but returned it due  to pathetic 3.5 hour battery life. I was surprised when I found out that this had an in-screen fingerprint reader. All my previous phones had one on the back. Andi it works fine FOR ME, I don\\'t know how good it is at preventing others from trying to open it with their prints. Try asking someone on the street: \"Hey, could you put your thumb on my phone here, please?\" I\\'d get locked up in no time, right?This is my first time owning a 5G capable phone and I\\'m impressed so far. I use Mint and it seems more responsive, and on my last 4G phone, it couldn\\'t get non-wifi internet access, but with this one I can. I don\\'t know why (don\\'t bother asking Mint that since Reynolds is too cheap to have even off-shore support). I\\'m not a \"smart phone\" person and don\\'t do any of the social stuff, but the phone is handy.It runs it own flavor of Android 12, with \"private\" tweaks much like the others, especially Samsung. It\\'s done two updates so far, one right after turning it on for the first time, then another a few weeks or so ago. I\\'ve had no operational issues. It does a better job of not draining the battery when I leave it in standby overnight, so I suspect that some of my apps on the other phone were \"running in the background\" and eating up the battery. This phone has a monitor that checks apps to see if they are eating the battery, and I got notifications about that. I was surprised when I started seeing my text messages on my PC screen (my 65\" Samsung living room TV) after \"bonding\" by phone to the PC via Microsoft\\'s latest effort to be more responsive to people\\'s needs to integrate their phones and PCs. Nice.This also has way faster Bluetooth download speeds than any other phone I\\'ve had yet. They all claim to be 5.0, and my PC is the same (e.g. no upgrades in the WiFi/Bluetooth area), but it\\'s faster. I mostly use that interface to download phone pics or videos for emailing that I do on my PC.The camera is OK. It often find out that my focus was off, once I download a pic to the PC. I\\'m not sure why, but I\\'ve always struggled with phone cams. It sucks that you get really hires pics and they\\'re not in focus. The phone also doesn\\'t compress the image much (e.g. original is 10MB or so and when I use Irfanview to \"save\" an image without cropping, it\\'s less than 2MB). Instead of buying this straight from T-Mobile for 300+ dollars, I got it on Amazon for a 50 dollar price markdown. I don\\'t regret it. For 250 dollars, you get not a FAST phone, but definitely a very RESPONSIVE phone: opening apps is relatively quick, web browsing is fluid and snappy, the screen gets nice and bright (to me), and there\\'s JUST enough power in the SOC (Snapdragon 695/Adreno 619) for some moderate gaming on the side. In my personal tests, older games like PUBG and Crossout Mobile get 60 FPS easy, more intensive games like Genshin Impact can hit 30 FPS, with an occasional stutter.The cameras aren\\'t that great, in my opinion, but that could be my awful photography skills. The speaker, however, gets nice and loud, and since my car doesn\\'t have bluetooth I can appreciate a loud speaker.I really hate the SIM/SD tray. Everybody does. We\\'ve really gone backwards with how we handle mobile phone expansion - just let us take off the back cover!All in all, solid value, and I\\'m very happy with it. I have had a Moto Z Play on Republic Wireless for five years. In 2022, it was still supporting the basic stuff (calls, messages, music, navigation, videos, and browsing), and the battery was in good shape. But, they ended support for WiFi calling on this device. Now I am running the Nord N20 5G on Mint Mobile.It\\'s similar in size, has the same near-stock android interface, exceptional battery life, crisp AMOLED display, lag-free Snapdragon 6 Series Platform, adequate camera, and limited OS upgrade support. Obviously, the processor is faster (Geekbench score of 2000 vs 500), the screen is larger (6.4\" vs 5.5\") and slightly brighter (461-647 nits vs 371-526 nits), the camera is sharper (64 MP vs 16 MP), the connectivity is better (faster WiFi, more 4G bands, and even a few 5G bands), and the OS is more recent (android 11 and 12 vs android 7 and 8). It was also 35% less expensive than the old phone ($275 with tax vs $435). And the new MVNO carrier is less expensive.The phone comes with a 33 watt charger and a USB-A to USB-C connector. It does not includes a case or screen protector. There is a tiny bit of bloatware, but it\\'s easy to remove. The OxygenOS is easy to setup so that it feels like stock android. The finger print sensor and face unlock work very well. My only grip is that the WiFi sometimes connects to my slower 2.4 GHz channels instead of my 5 GHz channels. I actually have three 2.4 GHz channels and four 5 GHz channels in my house, and they all have the same SSID. Unlike my other phones, the OnePlus seems to only show a preference for the strongest signal. I may have to rename my 2.4 GHz SSIDs to prevent this.The most stressful thing I did on this phone was to install Google Home and cast the screen to a Chromecast connected to my computer monitor. The Chromecast is hard wired to my network and my phone was connected to a 5 GHz WiFi channel with a bandwidth of about 300 Mbs. The phone performed very well. While playing a youtube video via the Chrome browser, the video and audio were in sync on the monitor. While scrolling through my Google feed, there was hardly any lag on either the phone or monitor.I have been testing this phone, on and off, for over 12 hours with about 4 hours of screen on time. The battery is at 67%. This is consistent with a battery endurance rating of 129 hrs on gsmarena, which is better than all of the iPhones and Galaxy S Series phones. For reference, the iPhone 13 max pro is rated for 121 hrs, and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G comes in at 114 hrs. Of course those phone are twice as fast, have a brighter 120Hz display, and much nicer cameras. But they also cost four times as much, and are running a bunch of extra processes that support all kinds of extraordinary features.If you want a mid-range phone, I would highly recommend this phone over the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G or Google Pixel 6a, both of which are about 30% more expensive. The A53 has descent battery life and better cameras, but is laggy and loaded with bloatware. The Pixel 6a has better cameras and a faster processor, but has poor battery life, is buggy, and even overheats. These other two phones will get more android upgrades, but these upgrades will most likely result in future issues with the phones. The only alternative that I would recommend to this phone is the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE, but only if you can get it new for $400. For under $250 (as paid on sale), this is a very impressive phone. AMOLED display and Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU to boot. The camera, as expected, is junk, but let\\'s be honest- you didn\\'t really expect a good camera at this price point. The phone is built really well and even looks high-end despite its plastic body. The only thing I wish it had was at least some level of water-resistance (there\\'s no IP rating).I was choosing between several Motorola models, including Stylus 5G and OnePlus N20 was a clear winner on paper because of OLED display. It also has very fast (33W) charging via USB PD. Seems Motorola has gone downhill in the last few years since its impressive G5 Plus released 4-5 years ago, especially so when it comes to OS updates- with only one major OS version update promised by the company. Granted, OnePlus has a similar policy and the N20 should only be updated to Android 12 (already updated), although the company allegedly promised Android 13 for N20, so will have to wait and see.I did debloat the Oxygen OS from all useless OnePlus crap, not to mention malware and spyware \"packaged\" with the phone. Adb is your friend here and rooting isn\\'t needed. Now I have an almost pure Android phone that looks good and performs well. Sorry, Motorola- you lost the cheap smartphone game to the Chinese... This is a great phone for the price!  The OS is pretty clean and the phone is quite fast.  I\\'m writing this review to point out some important caveats:1. T-Mobile is the only carrier that fully supports this phone (5G and WiFi calling).  AT&T only supports it at 4G and they don\\'t support WiFi calling on it.  Verizon doesn\\'t support this phone at all.2. Many OnePlus phones, including this one, don\\'t properly support Google Voice integration with the native phone app when Android v12 is installed.  All calls from the phone app will go out over the carrier pathway, regardless of what you\\'ve configured in the Google Voice app.  This has apparently been an issue since January 2022 and OnePlus doesn\\'t appear to have any plans to fix it.If those issues don\\'t impact you, then this phone is a far better choice than similarly priced phones from Samsung and Motorola due to the performance, features, and security patch support. Just love the OnePlus Nord N20 phone ð\\x9f¤³ for it is fast and fingerprint and face sensors are too and battery life good and such a pretty design.  My only issue is cannot access any other drives to choose photos to set as desktop and cannot set photos as desktop direct from other drives.  Maybe I should use another launcher and not use the Home Launcher. I\\'ve used it a couple of months now. I\\'m pretty happy. It took a little getting used to as it\\'s a different operating system, but it\\'s not too complicated. I like how all my Google apps work great on it. I don\\'t use any of the OnePlus apps, they seem like a waste of space. Reception is decent and camera works well. No glitches :) This phone took 3 calls to my carrier to get it to be completely usable. It was not fully unlocked. So far I like the responsiveness of this phone. Too many features for me though. There is a chat feature with security codes already enabled upon set up for encryption of texts...I suppose for sensitive info but annoying for me. Spent a ridiculous amount of time turning off these kinds of things and all the notifications I didn\\'t want. When I transferred my data from my old phone the pics and pics in texts did not transfer....and mms messages were not downloading. Ugh. another call to change something else within the interior workings of the phone andd now everything seems to be good. No complaints on the screen, fonts, etc... Received and returned it on the same day. Even though it\\'s described as \"U.S. Unlocked\", it doesn\\'t work with T-Mobile/Sprint, so I couldn\\'t activate it.  Had to go back and buy it from my carrier.  Now I â\\x9d¤ï¸\\x8f it.  Nice feel, big screen, 6 GB RAM expandable to 11 GB if unused memory is available.  My apps flow flawlessly on my 5G network, loaded up everything off my old Moto G6 and all performance issues are behind me.  Blazing fast charging, even on other than the 33w charger that came with it.  Excellent battery life.  Camera works fine; I\\'m not Ansel Adams.  But buy a case for it, the lenses sticks out a bit.  My case has a sliding cover for them so when not in use they\\'re well protected.  Buy this phone, just check with your carrier first to make sure they can activate it. Large screen, high resolution, the system is steady even when opening multiple apps, charging very fast.  It\\'s my best choice after comparing with other cell phones with the same price. I was surprised when I found out that this had an in-screen fingerprint reader. All my previous phones had one on the back. Andi it works fine FOR ME, I don\\'t know how good it is at preventing others from trying to open it with their prints.

Granted, OnePlus has a similar policy and the N20 should only be updated to Android 12 (already updated), although the company allegedly promised Android 13 for N20, so will have to wait and see.I did debloat the Oxygen OS from all useless OnePlus crap, not to mention malware and spyware \"packaged\" with the phone. Adb is your friend here and rooting isn\\'t needed. Now I have an almost pure Android phone that looks good and performs well. Sorry, Motorola- you lost the cheap smartphone game to the Chinese... This is a great phone for the price!  The OS is pretty clean and the phone is quite fast.  I\\'m writing this review to point out some important caveats:1. T-Mobile is the only carrier that fully supports this phone (5G and WiFi calling).  AT&T only supports it at 4G and they don\\'t support WiFi calling on it.  Verizon doesn\\'t support this phone at all.2. Many OnePlus phones, including this one, don\\'t properly support Google Voice integration with the native phone app when Android v12 is installed.  All calls from the phone app will go out over the carrier pathway, regardless of what you\\'ve configured in the Google Voice app.  This has apparently been an issue since January 2022 and OnePlus doesn\\'t appear to have any plans to fix it.If those issues don\\'t impact you, then this phone is a far better choice than similarly priced phones from Samsung and Motorola due to the performance, features, and security patch support. Just love the OnePlus Nord N20 phone ð\\x9f¤³ for it is fast and fingerprint and face sensors are too and battery life good and such a pretty design.  My only issue is cannot access any other drives to choose photos to set as desktop and cannot set photos as desktop direct from other drives.  Maybe I should use another launcher and not use the Home Launcher. I\\'ve used it a couple of months now. I\\'m pretty happy. It took a little getting used to as it\\'s a different operating system, but it\\'s not too complicated. I like how all my Google apps work great on it. I don\\'t use any of the OnePlus apps, they seem like a waste of space. Reception is decent and camera works well. No glitches :) This phone took 3 calls to my carrier to get it to be completely usable. It was not fully unlocked. So far I like the responsiveness of this phone. Too many features for me though. There is a chat feature with security codes already enabled upon set up for encryption of texts...I suppose for sensitive info but annoying for me. Spent a ridiculous amount of time turning off these kinds of things and all the notifications I didn\\'t want. When I transferred my data from my old phone the pics and pics in texts did not transfer....and mms messages were not downloading. Ugh. another call to change something else within the interior workings of the phone andd now everything seems to be good. No complaints on the screen, fonts, etc... Received and returned it on the same day. Even though it\\'s described as \"U.S. Unlocked\", it doesn\\'t work with T-Mobile/Sprint, so I couldn\\'t activate it.  Had to go back and buy it from my carrier.  Now I â\\x9d¤ï¸\\x8f it.  Nice feel, big screen, 6 GB RAM expandable to 11 GB if unused memory is available.  My apps flow flawlessly on my 5G network, loaded up everything off my old Moto G6 and all performance issues are behind me.  Blazing fast charging, even on other than the 33w charger that came with it.  Excellent battery life.  Camera works fine; I\\'m not Ansel Adams.  But buy a case for it, the lenses sticks out a bit.  My case has a sliding cover for them so when not in use they\\'re well protected.  Buy this phone, just check with your carrier first to make sure they can activate it. Large screen, high resolution, the system is steady even when opening multiple apps, charging very fast.  It\\'s my best choice after comparing with other cell phones with the same price. I also like the headphone jack which I use daily. The screen is more than enough resolution for what you pay for. With the latest update you could use the memory to add ram. So now it officially has 12gb of ram. Never had a problem with multitasking. Warp charge is nice. It lasts me at least a full day with heavy use. I\\'m having problems with my connection though every time I change regions. I have to turn the data connection off and on again. This is on US Mobile. That\\'s my only grip and it may only be carrier related but I\\'ve had other phones on this carrier and never had that issue. Anyways I really hope phone makers are ditching the \"infinity\" display for once and for all. That would be great. First off I would like to say I am really enjoying this phone.  The upgrade to Android 12 came with some great features that my old \"Android 12 Phone\" didn\\'t have.  The camera on this phone seems to get a bad rap in the reviews but it is prefectly adequate for day to day use.  I\\'m not a professional and it certainly fills my needs and has a whole host of cool features you can toggle into and use.  The display is crisp and the phone is fast and simply works well.  The battery life is for every and will easily stand two days of use.  I do not lock my phone so I can\\'t comment on the \"facial recognition or finger print reader\".  But the OS upgrade brought this great phone alive with some interesting features.  The phone also has a magnetometer and accelerometer built in that I really love for a couple app\\'s I like.The only criticisim I would have for the phone is the ring tones and notification tones could be much louder.  But for music or video the volumn is fine.  I had called OnePlus about this and they said that I could download louder ring tones and I did this and it did make a difference but this is the very first phone that I didn\\'t have to modulate the ring tone and notification tones.But other then that tihs is a wonderful device. Excelente equipo me siento satisfecho con la adquisiciÃ³n, solo que aveces se pone un poco lento, el reconocimiento de huella a veces no me funciona bien pero en cuanto a relaciÃ³n calidad precio y funcionabilidad es excelenteLo volverÃ\\xada a comprar Bought this one for my girlfriend, it\\'s been 2 months. It works pretty good, the battery seems not as good as I was expecting. Popped my Mint mobile sim card in... connected the second it finished booting up... Just updated to android 12, everything works great for me... phone has more features: tap to wake, raise to wake, more always on display setting. Great little device for $248 after tax. 33 watt fast charge, more like 30 watts for the first %6 lol. the fast charging is fine, but just like advertised \"charge speeds\" 33 watts even with the original charger is a \"theoretical max\" not what the rate is even for the first 25%. honeslty, it feels high end, like a real gaming phone. I would say it can easily compete with the Razer Phone 2 it had when it was new. Good refresh rate, and I was not aware of how many cool features the Nord phones have! I\\'m a big fan now! Packs a lot of power for the size and the battery Last a lot! I play a lot and it doesn\\'t heat at all. the interface is *chef kiss* I am going to make sure that my next phone is also a Nord too As of now it\\'s working as expected. Don\\'t expect alot of bells and whistles. It\\'s got all the Android features you\\'d expect in a low budget phone. Alot and I meand alot of tips and videos on YouTube will help you with the phone. It\\'s not a multitasker phone. Does not I repeat does not come with a music player. Or wireless charging. Read up before you buy so you know what you would have this for. I have multiple phone lines so this is my spam caller line for business. Personal no I\\'ll stick to anything else. But a great back up phone for now. Battery is ok so long as you tone down certain things. Quick charge and I suggest from what I\\'ve read only use the charger it came with and your battery will be fine. If you want to make this your everyday. All in all not bad for the price. And all the extras like case and screen protector are cheap when you get it. So that\\'s a plus. If anything goes wrong I\\'ll update. But go for it if you\\'re thinking of buying. Does the job and is decent mid-range value phone. Worked just fine for me on TMobile & second phone on myfamilymobile (TMobile).I am just a average phone user just use a handful of the common apps. Phone does what I need more than well enough.I was longtime Moto user but didn\\'t like latest models in this price range plus the screen size was getting too big. What made me choose was AMOLED screen & 5g, and not oversized screen size. Also it immediately updated to Android 12.Only cons I have are a few Android 12 or OnePlus UI features & customizations nit-picking. And I miss having dedicated fingerprint reader.I got it on sale at $230 which is good purchase. But at full 300 price I would just buy something else since that is not really value price It\\'s just a great laptop for which you pay a good price. Money well spent. I use it for app development and it performs very well I changed from a TCL 10l to a Nord N200 5G. I had an issue originally with the app switcher (right ð\\x9f\\x94³ on 3 button nav bar) not working, even after factory resetting. They continued to work with me to resolve the issue and eventually escalated it to the devs, who also were great with communicating (and honest about not knowing what the issue is after a lot of troubleshooting, but would keep investigating).It turns out my prefered launcher that automatically installed at setup was the issue. I had to uninstall/reinstall the launcher and app switcher works. Uninstall/reinstall an app has resolved most of my issues. Now everything is working great and the battery lasts a long time even when playing games.The single speaker isn\\'t great but at this price level corners get cut. It has updated to Android 12. Camera is great, battery lasts all day, fingerprint sensor reads much better than my last phone, phone material feels great in the hand, got a case from Amazon, & Amazon let me pay in 4 without applying for a credit card. With Crickets service, Nord N20 ($230) is more favorable to my Moto G Stylus (2021, $145) that I gave to my son.  Speed is OK (2.2GHz, same as MOTO).  4G connection (no 5G supported) is reliable and clocks in around 40Mbs while a home WIFI is used a lot.  Battery lasts a whole day.  AMOLED screen is better.  Nord is light to carry.  Less apps also come installed.  Overall, I like it due to the screen, lightness and less junk apps.  BTW, I play no games, so I don\\'t know about those, only about Internet (YouTube, Facebook, shopping), texting, phone service and overall daily activities.  Plus, I wait for so long for AMOLED to come down near 2 Benjamin\\'s.  Any companies out there can beat this price with this type of screen?  NONE... Works well with few issues. Fingerprint reader can be hit or miss. Despite of very low price for that product it turned to be a real underdog!The only issue - it is the rear camera. It\\'s poor... Phone is great good features does everything I needed to do except! I cannot connect multiple bluetooth speakers which is the only reason I bought this model because it has Bluetooth 5.1 but I guess I should have did more research because it\\'s Bluetooth 5.2 that has that option otherwise great phone. I use a phone for phone calls, texting, playing music in the car, and occasional web browsing.  This phone does the trick.  I don\\'t play games on the phone or watch movies so my graphics and processor demands are limited.  The camera is adequate for snapshots.  The second tier 5G capability is a nice to have although I found 4G adequate for my needs.  The hardware test was the browser front end for a Raspberry Pi music streamer.  My previous phone couldn\\'t run it.  I think it was memory bound and the additional 2 GB made the difference in response time.  The only con for me is that it\\'s a bit narrow making the landscape display too small in the vertical direction.  I have larger than average hands so I\\'m not at the human factors mid point.  I hope not to replace it for several years. For the price, this phone is a step up from my old Galaxy S8 and Xcover pro. Apps run smoothly without lag and the processor is fast to where it can do anything I throw at it. The 4500mah battery lasts me the whole day and although I\\'m missing the 60fps on cameras, 30fps isn\\'t so bad either. I don\\'t play games so I don\\'t know for sure how it will perform with the Adreno 617 but I\\'m guessing it\\'ll perform fairly well. For $300, 6GB ram, 128GB storage, and a big battery really, this makes the best bang for the buck phone. There have also been no problems that I have encountered since the purchase of this phone.Update October 6th: The phone has zero issues and I have since bought another one for my father as a gift and he seems to enjoy it over the company phone he received.Update November 2nd: The phone is still one of the best upgrades that I have gotten myself and my father. There is no issue with the phone and I still use it daily. One of the things that is really useful is that I don\\'t have to worry about not having enough ram to run youtube in small-picture mode while browsing chrome, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, or reading manga on Tachiyomi. The main complaint I had about my s8 or Xcover pro was not having enough ram to multitask while having youtube open (picture in picture mode). Now, every time I check my ram usage while using youtube and browsers, I have at least 1.8GB or 2GB of ram ready in reserve and it helps a lot.Update Dec 9: Recieved the android 12 update and so far, no issues at all with the new OS. I am also guessing that android 12 will be the final update since the support page has stated that updates/security support will last until the start of 2023 (probably will end near April of 2023). This Nord 20 is great, just what I was looking for. I have always liked Motorola phones, but this has better features, like up to date software and upgrades. The battery seems good so far, lasts awhile. So far, I am very happy with this phone. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nÂ\\xa0This phone was purchased in like new condition. It showed up two days after purchase. It looks brand new updated to the newest version of iOS. Iâ\\x80\\x99m coming from an iPhone to an android again so far this phone is really good. It feels nice in your hand. Picture quality is, really good seamless gaming videos are fine face recognition and fingerprint sensors work well downside is speakers could be better, but it does the job Iâ\\x80\\x99m working off of cricket wireless this is an unlocked phone. Everything seems to be working out so far so good. I\\'ve had more expensive phones but this is by far the best phone I have bought it does everything I need I would suggest getting a micro SD card to store your music and videos but overall it\\'s awesome I love this phone especially the price I got it for Great price. Surprised of all the memory it has. Whats the deal here? TMobile sells this phone yet the one I purchased from Amazon does not or cannot be used on TMO.  I first called Amazon but they could not help me on the phone. Then I called Sprint/TMO, same deal. Went to the store and thats when they told me it can not be used on the TMO network, what? So if I purchase it from them its okay? Purchase from someone else, NOT gonna work.  This may just be the start of something new that maybe the attorney general should know about.  So be aware if you are a sprint/tmo customer do not purchase this phone. So far the first week I\\'m enjoying it. It\\'s a different phone for my last one and it\\'s taking a little bit of getting used to but overall it seems fast and that\\'s when I need. I like everything about the phone except for the battery life. It\\'s seem to deplete as fast as my 3 year old phone that I replaced with this one. I probably exchange for a different model. I like it\\'s performance and look Gran Calidad y excelente precio Print I\\'d is glitchy. I was kinda scared because I read it was unlocked but for US ONLY on the description, Iâ\\x80\\x99m currently living in Ecuador and it was a gift for my mom.Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad to say the phones working fine, it was easy to set up, I like how light it is compared to the old Samsung my mom had.I strongly advice you do the fingerprint scan before putting a screen protector on. Itâ\\x80\\x99s kinda tricky to get the fingerprint the correct way!Facial recognition works just fine.Battery life is pretty good, considering she only uses the phone for social networks and games.Pretty happy with the buy! On my old phone, a full workday would leave me at about 30% or less by five. That means any dates, outings, or even just chill time after work would need one of those portable power blocks or a quick recharge beforehand.Now, my phone might, just might be down to 70% at the end of my work day. That\\'s just amazing. Its so freeing to not need to watch my battery like it\\'s my life any more.Beyond that, it\\'s also super light weight, smaller than my old LG Stylo 6 (I consider it a plus since it doesn\\'t fall out of my pocket so much), and much, much faster. The stats on the phone is nice. The battery charged full in about 30 minutes and lasts all day even when I\\'m streaming. I\\'m disappointed in the front camera it\\'s blurry but other then that no problems So far this phone has been pretty dang great, I work for a cleaning company and we have to use an app for our service to clock in etc so I do find that it tends to use a bit more battery but it still last all day, I previously used Motorola brands I will never go back to them again. It has amazing cameras both front and back camera take beautifully stunning photos!!! Times the touch screen can be a little bit laggy but also I think that that could be my phone service just being an a pain!! Overall I\\'m very very happy with it definitely worth the price it\\'s unlocked however if you do try to use straight talk it will not work because straight talk is now only  Verizon towers and this is unlocked for GSM only! The OnePlus 2 was my first phone from their brand. I was extremely ecstatic with the direction One Plus was going in. The OnePlus 3 was my last phone, as soon as the OnePlus 3T came out they had moved in the direction of other major players in the market. They were overcharging for their devices and making incremental changes to sell a new phone.  With the release of this phone and my unhappiness with my recent Google Pixel 6 Pro, I decided to try OnePlus again. I am extremely happy with this phone. It\\'s not like the old days when you bought a mid-range phone and you lost access to a lot of important features.  Frankly, this phone feels more responsive than my Pixel was, mostly because the 5G antenna is so much better.  I get 5G with this OnePlus phone where I wouldn\\'t even get 4G on my Pixel.  Long story short, it\\'s worth every penny.  Check the features before you buy it to make sure there\\'s nothing you can\\'t live without, but the only thing that I found most people probably won\\'t like is the lack of wireless charging.  Other than that, I\\'ve been extremely happy. Really like the ability to run 5G speed and in my area see 300+ Mb/s speeds. Use a screen protector and case on the phone and it is set for normal use. Camera function is good for close in shots but only has 6X magnification for distance. Battery life is good, my experience is daily it drains to 75% before charging back to 100% over night. BTW, I use a timer of 90 minutes to charge the battery. Even though the phone controls the charging, to stop the possibility of overcharging. It might extend battery life. As always OnePlus does it again. By far the best phone brand I have ever owned. Out preforms the other name brands time and time again. For three quarters of the price. If you\\'ve never owned one, you need to. The product does not contain clear information that it has only one sim card and one SD (memory) card. It also does not have an opportunity to add a virtual card of the second sim card. So if you want a cellphone with more than one sim card, this cellphone is not the option you look for. It would be great to have this clear information in the product description. For the price, this is the best phone on the market right now. Beautiful, fast and a good battery. The speakers are awesome; loud and clear.I do not usually like Android-based operating systems, but I cannot afford what Apple wants for phones and I am not willing to buy a phone without a headphone jack (this one has one, by the way). However, OnePlus has lots of really good system features and offers a good Android experience here. I love their file manager.The camera isn\\'t anything spectacular, but as someone who uses DSLR cameras, I don\\'t like to use a phone for anything spectacular anyway. This camera is more than fine for day-to-day family moments and the photos certainly are not ugly.The performance is not bad, either. I play games on it and have not had any lag issues. It\\'s a quality phone. I\\'m really glad I bought it. Awesome camera quality and outstanding battery life Excellent Bought this to replace my delicate and always breaking Google Pixel and I genuinely keep forgetting that it isn\\'t the Pixel because it is so nice. What a steal this phone is - I just wish I bought it first before dumping a ton of money into a junk product like the Pixel. That thing was so fragile that the guys at the UbreakIFix store all said they were notorious and they couldn\\'t keep parts in stock for it. I migrated from a LG K20 running Android 7 to this OnePlus Nord N20 5G 6 GB RAM 128 GB ROM because I needed new medical apps that require at least Android 8 and the LG had no updates available beyond 7. I immediately found that that the LG K20 was way more user friendly with way better function options. In spite of my OnePlus Nord N20 being 5G with 6gb RAM/128gb ROM, it has horrible phone connectivity issues that I didn\\'t have with my old Android 7. At arbitrary times during calls, my phone mic would quit or my phone wouldn\\'t transmit my voice, sometimes for minutes! The screen touch is far too sensitive, often activating functions that hadn\\'t been selected just because my finger or thumb were close. There seems to be no sensitivity adjustment anywhere. There is no wifi calling setting available to set my wifi calling preference, that I can find. I certainly wouldn\\'t recommend this phone to anyone. I\\'m researching what is involved in returning it. Bought to replace son\\'s Nord N10 with a broken screen (not usable) and was not disappointed. Easily transferred all info over within a few minutes and had it up and running. I was tired of paying a lot to get an AMOLED screen. I was glad that I waited to get this one from Amazon and not from T-Mobile so as to not get the locked T-Mobile bloatware.  Nord N20 appears to really have good 5G antennas as I get good coverage in all my areas on T-Mobile or maybe it is just frequency bands. The main thing you do on your phone is to look at the screen and this screen is excellent and you can see it with polarized sunglasses. I also like that you can select dark screen with icons and text lit which saves battery,  If you are on T-Mobile or one of its dedicated MVNOs you might consider this phone. Do your research. The phone has good speed, an excellent display, gets great reception with Mint Mobile and the fingerprint scanner is the best I have used to date. Battery life is great, checking an email /social media is fine, trying to watch videos including videos from my old phone are very choppy and jerky. Would not buy another one.11/30/22There was a big update and the video issues are corrected on my phone.  I tried a few different platforms and no issues.Now, I\\'d buy another one. I purchased this as a replacement phone for my sister who accidentally dropped her phone and killed it. She had a OnePlus 6 and the phone is leaps and bounds better than her old phone. Super fast and responsive plus a camera that rivals many higher end phones. The battery life is easily good for a day and a half and the recharge is twenty minutes from 20% to a full charge. We have been using OnePlus phones for about three years and have never been disappointed! I know it was only $200,but the camera is just barely good, and reaction time is very pokey.  Blue-tooth is slow to aquire, but OK after that.  A lot of the problem, I think, is because of battery optimization.  when I call up a game, that I was playing 5 minutes, it basically has to start up again.  This phone is merely a place holder I\\'m very happy with this phone. The Best way. This is a super solid phone that punches above it\\'s weight class.Pros:The best battery life I\\'ve seen in a phone. Definitely a 2 day phone.Beautiful screen.Build quality feels like a phone at least twice the price in the hands.Fingerprint reader is quick and accurate.Smooth and snappy, never felt sluggish.33w fast charging is super quick.Cons:No fast refresh screen.Only Android 11.Cameras are fine for it\\'s price, but this is where it shows it\\'s price.Overall a super solid phone. Danielstechstudio has a more in depth review on you tube, but this is my go to recommendation if you\\'re looking for the best budget phone out right now. Also very surprising that this is so good, seeing as the Nord n200 from last year was horrible. Great reception and good camera. Fingerprint works best of any phone I\\'ve had. I bought these to replace 2 year old Moto G Powers (2020 model), which were fairly nice phones. These are much nicer and my triplet boys are very happy with them. They play games better, the fingerprint reader works way better than the one on my Google Pixel 6 Pro (which isn\\'t saying much, sadly). They do come with some crapware, which is annoying and I have no idea why that\\'s legal for an unlocked phone. I didn\\'t realize they had NFC, which was a nice bonus. One weird thing with the google family plan I haven\\'t figured out yet is that they don\\'t update the location very well. Probably a permissions issue. I bought this phone as a spare phone in addition to our more expensive iphones. This one exceeds my expectations for a entry level android phone as it is fast, well built and does not have much non-google UI stuff pre-installed that one needs to worry. The over response is snappy and the cam works fast and produces fairly high quality pictures. Lo bueno! Es un oneplus,lo malo! La cÃ¡mara, si buscas buenas fotos o videos este no es el dispositivoLo bueno! La carga,Lo malo! La resoluciÃ³n de pantalla y lo re malo el desbloqueo facial es pÃ©simo.Respecto al resto pues se mantiene en la media ni muy muy ni tan tan This phone is amazing for the price I paid. I needed to get an upgrade for my father in laws Moto Z3 Play. This thing is an actual â\\x80\\x9cupgradeâ\\x80\\x9d that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t break the bank. He uses Cricket Wireless which means no 5g but gets solid 4g coverage. Super fast, just seems to work.I bought him a Galaxy A53 5g and that things Bluetooth didnâ\\x80\\x99t work in his car! A quick Google search revealed itâ\\x80\\x99s a common problem with no known fix going back months. Thank heavens for amazons return policy and no restocking bull crap that companies like Best Buy try to pull. Will update if The phone has issues. So, I upgraded from OnePlus 7 Pro.A great phone BTW. Upgraded to Nord N 20 5G, pro\\'s and consPro\\'s,Great batteryGreat cell service connection, from my previous phone above.ConsOk Camera, however the older phone has much better camera.Slower phone tooSpace okSo if you are looking for Camera or speed, stay away,But if you just need great battery and connection go for it.And the price is great, I bought it during sale from Amazon. I absolutely love this phone. It\\'s responsive and has a lot of great features that my previous phone didn\\'t have. I got almost two full days on one battery charge. Pictures and camera are far better than the Samsung flip that this was replacing. Unfortunately, while it will work with AT&T for calls and text, it will not work for data. Apps will only work on Wi-Fi.  If you only use apps while on Wi-Fi then I can\\'t recommend this phone enough. But if you want to stream your music in your car or use apps like Waze and you have AT&T, forget it. I purchased this for my Mom (it works in USA/Nepal). This has quick charge, long battery life, great camera, amazing screen, and pretty snappy ... this is great value for the money I paid. I ran with the Nord N10 for 2 years before wanting an upgrade. I compared this phone to the Samsung A53, and for $50 more than the Nord N20 you get a while lot more, including:-120 Hz display (Nord N20 is 60Hz)-5000 Ma battery life (Nord N20 has 4500 Ma)-5G on AT&T (Nord N20 does not support it)-Android 12 (Nord N20 has 11, at the time of writing this there is no date for upgrade)-Better camera configuration and picture quality (One Plus cuts corners here massively)There are a few other negatives to this phone, but honestly other than the inscreen fingerprint reader, felt like a clone to the N10. Honestly expected much more from One Plus. Easy to use Awesome battery life. A nice change. Muy bueno se los recomiendo El telÃ©fono funciona muy bien. La baterÃ\\xada rinde mÃ¡s de 2 dÃ\\xadas sin cargar. Se carga en 1 hora aproximadamente de 0 a 100. Tiene cobertura 5g en todas partes con la red de Mint Mobile (T-Mobile). Funciona bien en juegos y no se calienta. La pantalla de se bien en todas condiciones y usando el modo oscuro. A pesar de todo eso lo tuve que devolver ya que le saliÃ³ un punto de pixel muertos en la pantalla. QuizÃ¡s sea un defecto de la unidad que comprÃ©. Por eso las 3 estrellas. Use this phone for couple days. The experience is not very good.There is no reason to crash twice,It\\'s not because the phone is too hot to crash.The normal use of mobile phones also frequently appears stuck. The power consumption of the battery is average, similar to my iPhone12.You get what you pay for, so you don\\'t need to expect too much for a mobile phone at this price. This is a decent phone. However, the loading time for the home screen is atrocious. It takes like 5-6 seconds to load and I\\'ve only used it for a month. And the seller is amazon. Weird. Phone was in a protective case and i was sitting in a chair low to the ground when i dropped this 2 month old phone while taking it out of my pocket. The touch screen and lcd broke after about a 2-3 foot drop onto the floor. A drop my old phone (moto g6) had survived hundreds if not thousands of times. The glass on the n20 didn\\'t even crack or shatter it was such a light fall, but now I have dead lcd lines and a broken digitizer that prevents the touch screen from accepting any inputs. What\\'s worse is that usually budget phone replacement parts are cheaper than on flagship models, but not this phone. My local repair store Quoted me $230 to replace the screen and didgitizer. When I bought the phone brand new for $250. I thought they might be upcharging me but i the lowest repair quote i could find was for $200. Then i thought if i can find the parts maybe I\\'ll do replace it myself, but this phones screen is too expensive. The cheapest i could find the screen and didgitizer was $130. where the oneplus n10 screens and n200 screens are $40-$50. This is poor internal build quality. It was not a hard drop at all and again it was in a solid protective case.I bought this phone because it looked like a good value for the money. It has a decent processor good amount of RAM and memory, and ran well, but I REGRET BUYING THIS PHONE. IT IS FRAGILE AND COSTS TOO MUCH MONEY TO REPAIR.I\\'ve been a budget phone user for years and I understand that part of the budget is materials that aren\\'t as fancy My last phone (a moto g6 which lasted almost 4 years and thousands of drops before breaking the charge port). But this phone is not just cheaper materials. Its a cheap design that is waiting to break as soon as it has it\\'s first run in with gravity.If i get a chance I\\'ll post a quick video this trash phone so noone can accuse me of veing a bot for the competition. The Nord N20 5G is speedy. Looks good. And has a very nice camera. You get a headphone jack! An SD Card slot!!. 128GB storage to boot!. And Oxygen OS runs great so far. I get the best signal I have ever gotten. Which is a huge PLUS!. Didi Mao, get yourself a Nord NOW! Looks like a great phone and it is advertised as Unlocked, which to me, meant I could take it to any carrier. WRONG! As of this writing, this phone will not work on Verizon. I was really liking this phone, but lately it has been freezing, which makes me have to restart it every time it happens. I just might send it back while I can. So no far is working good and works perfect in Canada. Hard to beat for the price, especially if you can find it on sale!  I love that it has a headphone jack.  Works great on the T-Mobile network. The media could not be loaded. This is a good phone. The OxygenOS is clean with almost no bloatware. But be cautious, I think this phone only works in T-Mobile\\'s network (including MVNO, like Mint Mobile, Tello and etc.). Easy to hold and operate. I have had the phone for about a month and like the Wifi, screen display. No complaints. Nice screen, battery and quick and responsive. All the bells and whistles on a budget phone Decent build. Basic camera function, donâ\\x80\\x99t expect great photos with this cheap phone. It starts to lag when running multiple streaming apps.This phone came unlocked with one Sim card slot. Memory can be expanded with a microSD card.The screen is pretty sharp nice viewing angles and the fingerprint scanner is pretty fast. This phone also comes with face unlock but it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t work for apps. Good alternative to Samsung phones. Me ubiera gustado un poco mÃ¡s grande, muy buen sonido en el carro en todo lo demÃ¡s estÃ¡ muy bien quede satisfecho gracias The battery is amazing and last so long, also the pictures come out great, love the camera, so far it\\'s been about a week, and I really love it amazing, I think so far the best phone I have ever had. It look nice, its stylish, feels good in the hand, nice weight to it. 10/10 would buy again and I would most defentilly recomend this to my friends and family. In my case I am facing some issues with Bluetooth system sound when I calling via what\\'s app . It is disconnecting every time while in a video call in what\\'s app. But for music it\\'s working fine. It\\'s an average phone that works well and does what I need. It came at a great price and is compatible with my provider. The keyboard layout is a little unusual, but one gets used to it. Update 10-14-2022Still trash, For some unknown reason messages from whatsapp are not showing up at the lock screen. It does not wake the screen either. Sometimes I don\\'t even see the messages looking at the screen. No pop ups. I checked all notifications settings including lockscreen settings to show all info and nothing man this phone is so trash. Better off buying the n10, I updated this review from 3 stars to 1. How the hell did oneplus f up this phone.Very disappointed with the downgrade from oneplus. Most apps I used on the Nord n10 don\\'t fit the screen anynore, I can\\'t see the time stamp on youtube shorts because it doesn\\'t fit to screen. When you get a whapsapp message you can\\'t reply from the notification bar because it doesn\\'t fit you cant even see what you are typing can click send. I don\\'t recommend this phone to anyone, you are better off getting the N200. Also the keyboard is lifted from the bottom of the screen and sometimes you can\\'t see where you are typing. Overall 0.5 out of 5. The screen sucks.Adding more: Bluetooth audio drops randomly and every app won\\'t play videos/music for about 1 minute. You can see the song time moving then you get the audio delayed. This doesn\\'t happen on galaxy s8 or s20 or pc. I had the N10 for longer and I never had any issues, this only made me never buy an oneplus product ever again. I ordered this phone and the GPS feature did not work at all.  I tried all sorts of ways to fix it which were recommended by the manufacturer as well as my network provider.  I even tried a factory reset.  Nothing worked.  I returned the damaged phone and ordered a new one.  Again, the GPS does not work.  I do not recommend this phone. Fast delivery and received my phone as described Excellent The phone is great, exactly what I\\'ve come to expect from OnePlus. A higher end budget phone with everything I need.I almost returned it on principle due to the arrival condition, the package was opened, the phone was wrapped in a paper towel, the factory screen protector was missing, and the power cord had been hastily shoved back in the box, the booklet and sim remover key were missing entirely. I was clearly shipped a returned/or refurbished device with nothing in the listing providing this information. I tested the device an found no damage or flaws however if this is what the seller/amazon considers ok then I will have to shop elsewhere Perfecto para mÃ\\xad uso diario, gran capacidad para fotos y buena cÃ¡mara OnePlus n20 5g is Very good budget phone, I bought this phone as a gift to my father, replacd his iphone 8+pro,he likes this phone.everything is easy and smooth Excellent 5G under budget. Decent camera and overall good functionality! Solid phone for the priceBut the screen is the main buying point for the price.Extremely color accurate and bright It didn\\'t work. I couldn\\'t make calls. I couldn\\'t receive calls. I couldn\\'t send texts. I couldn\\'t get data. I couldn\\'t get on my own WIFI. I got a replacement SIM card. It didn\\'t help. For two months I tried to get it to work. I spent hours on the phone with clueless tech support kids. It was the worst excuse for a phone I\\'ve ever had. King for budget phones As slick and nice as this phone feels i have to rate it 1 star because the main screen freezes every 2 hours or so and needs a restart, making it completely unviable as a useful device. Will be returning this product ASAP, and others say they have the same problem so be careful when buying this phone. You will require patience. i have been on chat for over an hour and i keep getting info to do stuff that is not even on the phone.  it is almost impossible to switch to vibrate without going thru multiple screens.  the vibrate button on the top swipe down disappeared Disliked the fact that the Nord N20 5G phone is so heavy influenced by Google. Its a shame that a single company can wield that much influence on society today. Thought that was one of the reasons the government split up Ma Bell? Just about every app on this phone is powered by Google. Sent them back as we do not want Google in or monitoring everything we do,  say and go. Phone did have good battery life and I do miss the 5G connectivity but I will survive with my old 4G phone. During setup it was crystal clear and vibrant,  as soon as I was done with setup, it appeared to go into eye saver/reading/night mode where everything had a sepia or yellowish tone and no settings hinted as to why. Even turning brightness all the way up and setting the color setting to cool, all of the blue light was omitted. There were no settings anywhere that would undo this. Looked up a fix online and this seems to be a problem with many of the 1+ phones. A reboot fixed it in my case. But then it soon reverted back. Not keeping a phone I have to reboot constantly just to keep my screen settings constant. It went back. Happy 5 Month review: I was hoping that this was a return to OnePlus\\'s roots; quality hardware at a low price with near-stock Android. Unfortunately, their OS has become very bloated over the years: \"suggestions\", \"recommendations\", and notifications from apps that cannot be uninstalled. In short, this phone is covered in un-skippable ads from head to toe. I\\'ll never buy from OnePlus ever again. Thank you, 1+ Nothing good to say except for the battery life.If you live in US stay away from this phone- it doesn\\'t have Volte, a required functionality of many companies. I\\'m forced to keep a foreign sim to have data.- Pictures are not that good. X2 and x5 zoom take pixelated pictures.- signal reception bad, my old Samsung have where this doesn\\'t. And many up and downs on data speed because signal.- screen touch sometimes don\\'t detect the touch properly- I wish I had checked everything properly on time to return itI thought was a good phone as had many positive reviews... We had a one plus 5 phone so trusted the brand and bought this. Nonetheless in less than 60 days, the phone started to give major issues. Network dropped unexpectedly and cellular signal would not work despite being in high cellular network areas. GPS on phone did not work too well either. Completely lost full money and never buying this brand again :( I am a Verizon customer, could not use this product. Publicidad engaÃ±osa No esta desbloqueado para todos los proveedores de servicio.!!!ð\\x9f¤·ð\\x9f\\x8f»â\\x80\\x8dâ\\x99\\x82ï¸\\x8f So different from other phones that learning curve is a major pain. I bought this phone and was super excited about it. This phone is not unlocked. Now I ba e a phone I\\'m using that\\'s taped together. I\\'m also having problems returning it. When I put the sim card in, the phone was able to display the phone number details but tmobile would not connect the service. The only way to use this is by connecting it to wifi. I got one from tmobile for the same price anyway. The phone is fine but this description is not honest. Cheap not worth the money while being advertised as UNLOCKEDThis phone is CARRIER LOCKED TO ATT.. it refuses to process the unlock  with the device unlock app.. returning...  1 star review for false advertising Don\\'t listen to the product title. The phone isn\\'t actually unlocked This phone is cheap it\\'s not worth the price.  Don\\'t waste your money. Buyers should be aware that this unlocked OnePlus Nord N20 5G (128 GB) works in 5G mode only with T.Mobile. With AT&T, it is LTE mode (2G/3G/4G LTE) and not compatible with Verizon in any G. Please check OnePlus website for further details about compatibility.  It has only one speaker. Though the phone comes in Android 11, it gets upgraded to Android 12 version automatically. WiFi Calling feature and all the 5G features are available only in T. Mobile. My primary uses are calls, messages, WhatsApp, checking emails, some social media posts, taking few pics once a while, etc. This phone suits perfectly well, for my needs. My old phone Moto G Play (32 GB) used to operate in 2G/3G/4G (LTE) environment. The new phone OnePlus Nord N20 5G is lightening fast in every task. Very good phone for this price. Bright screen, snappy response.The notifications are so low that I miss texts all day long. I am writing this review with the phone on Metro by T-Mobile\\'s 5G network, and it is an excellent phone. At the time of this review, I got this phone for $50 when I switched from another carrier. I have a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra but wanted something different to use and I really like it. It\\'s got a beautiful AMOLED display, plenty of storage, gets great reception, and the battery lasts forever. I didn\\'t realize how much I missed having a headphone jack until I got one back! The build quality surprised me as I have not had a phone made out of metal for a long time, which makes it tougher than a phone made of glass. It has an underscreen fingerprint sensor that is compatible with glass screen proctectors, further increasing durability. Also, the charging speed is pretty dang fast. As for the speed of the phone, it\\'s snappy for everyday things, but do not expect it to play games like an S22 Ultra. The camera is decent, it leaves some room for improvement but for the price you can\\'t really complain. I took a photo of a hibiscus flower to give you an idea of the camera quality. At this price point, I\\'d be hard pressed to find another deal like this, even at full price. I highly recommend this phone. What do you get when you combine iPhone level optics, reliability, and security with Samsung compatibilityâ\\x80\\x94and throw in a display that rivals them both? The OnePlus N20 5G. With an edge to edge display and a steel frame reminiscent of an iphone, the N20 has certainly made it\\'s parents proud. The touch registration is instantaneous, the display is vivid and responsive.  It\\'s a flagship phone for middling price. The only test that remains is the test of time. Won\\'t work on Verizon or Straight Talk. Wish I had known that before I bought it. I like everything about this phone except that it did not come with even the most minimal instructions. I had to ask my son how to answer it when it rang. I still haven\\'t gotten texting and messages correct. These are basic things that everyone seems to do with their phones. I am older and at this point we are going to be off the landline and functioning with the cell phone.The screen is very clear and easy to read although I think I want to see if I can make the fonts bigger. I know that after a while I will feel more comfortable with it. I am disabled and am happy that when I have to drive for errands now that I can call for help if needed. This phone is so different than my last cell phone, that only had phone capabilities but I gave up when I could no longer work 20+ years ago.I appreciate the opportunity to try this out. Thank you. OnePlus is known for making quality products that consumers can purchase for a fraction of the price of the competition. These phones are feature rich and it shows when using them. The Nord N20 is no slouch when it comes to handling tasks, the camera is great, the size of the phone is very nice and feels comfortable in the hand. The screen is full of color and the built in fingerprint reader is quick and accurate. So why 3 stars? The phone will not be getting the new android 13 update, nor the previous Android 12. While this is supposed to be a budget phone, it is not getting the software treatment that it deserves. As a result, I am docking this heavily to push consumers to one of their other devices for roughly the same amount of money. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nÂ\\xa0This phone is probably the best budget Android smart phone with the minimum sacrifice of some features. I absolutely love the big bright AMOLED screen, long battery power, and huge 128GB built in storage, plus expandable microSD slot. I inserted a 256GB microSD card along with my Mint mobile SIM, and now this phone has more storage than my MacBook Air. Mint mobile works okay in my area, so I have no issue using this phone for calling and mobile data connection. I see VoLTE turned on along with 5G connection here and there outside my home, and the connection speed is nothing less than I expected from Mint mobile.This phone has 64 megapixel triple camera, so my expectation was a little high, but then, I was quickly disappointed that it did not have a wide-angle lens. The overall photo quality is good, and I love the â\\x80\\x98Dual-View Videoâ\\x80\\x99 that both front and rear camera record videos at the same time in the same frame. Using that feature is super fun because recording my facial expression when recording something else at the same time is awesome. However, I am still debating whether I like the AI effects on the faces. I could control the amount of effects or turn the effects off if I wanted, but it is kind of amazing what phone cameras can do in real time these days. I am not a selfie person, but this phone does take very nice photos for sure. For the video shooting, this feature is the major con in my opinion; it only can shoot 1080P at 30 frame per seconds. I expected 4k video shooting capability considering the storage amount, but sadly, it only does 1080P 30fps. Well, I cannot expect everything from a budget smartphone.However, somehow, this phone has under display fingerprint scanner. I have never tried under display fingerprint sensor, but it worked way faster than I expected, and now it is my favorite feature from this phone. The phone wakes up when lifted from idle position and shows the finger printing area on the bottom of the screen, and it takes no time to scan my fingerprint once I put my thumb on it. However, I would like the phone to wake up when I knock on it as well, instead of lifting.There are some other small things, such as no stereo speaker, no dual sim (e-sim) option, and no wireless charging that I consider as compromising for the budget, but this phone still has NFC and Google Pay capability along with 5G connection. Also, there still is 3.5mm headphone jack (no headphone or earbuds included).So, overall, I am happy with this phone. This phone is budget friendly, yet snappy and capable of everything I do with a smartphone in my daily life, and I especially enjoy its beautiful AMOLED screen and long lasting battery. this phone is awesome on t-mobile. for the price its probably the best unlocked phone you can get, with a couple exceptions. first off i compared this against a Samsung galaxy a52. they\\'re similar in price and around the same specs. the pictures taken with this in daylight are great, maybe even better than the Samsung as far as color accuracy. in low light however the Samsung is definitely the better due to a lot of lost details in the photos from the Nord.the screen is an amoled, but compared to the Samsung\\'s its a bit less bright and the colors aren\\'t as vibrant.the phone itself is quick and light. the fingerprint and face unlock are much faster than the Samsung, the call quality is also slightly better, although the Samsung has dual speakers and gets louder, especially on speaker.this is an unlocked phone and will work on at&t or T-Mobile as well as the various prepaid versions, metro and cricket wireless. however, if you\\'re using it on at&t service it will only operate on the lte network. the reason for this is that the bands needed for at&t 5g are missing from this phone. now, i do get decent speeds on lte, around 30mbps, and 5g service in my area is spotty and averages the same on my Samsung due to that. so, if you\\'re not concerned with 5g on at&t carriers and want a good unlocked phone that you can use with either provider this is a good choice. if you need 5g speeds and use at&t then i would check out the Samsung a52. The OnePlus Nord N20 5G is the successor to the N10 5G, sitting just above the Nord N200 in the company\\'s lineup as another mid-ranger from the company. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an attractive-looking phone, and it feels great in the hand. An AMOLED display, an actual good 64MP main camera, excellent performance, and nearly 2-day battery life round out what\\'s seriously the best cheap phone(opens in new tab) I\\'ve used in years. This phone is very thin, yet doesn\\'t shy away from a big battery. I easily got a day and a half out of every single charge. Storage is also expandable on the Nord N20 via micro SD card â\\x80\\x93 a luxury that few phones have afforded us in recent years.OnePlus opted for a quality AMOLED panel that looks simply fantastic all the time. It\\'s got those deep infinite blacks that only AMOLEDs can make, and the colors pop without looking unrealistic. I\\'d love to see a brighter panel in next year\\'s phone, but it\\'s not bad by any means. If anything, it\\'s just hard to photograph, and you\\'ll notice my outdoor photos of the display have a decidedly dim-grey look to the display because of it. Photos look very different in the viewfinder than they do after being processed by the phone, making it hard to know if a snap will get much better or much worse once you press the shutter, and we could have done without the gimmicky macro camera.However, the phone will bug you multiple times during and after setup to install more â\\x80\\x9cpremium app suggestionsâ\\x80\\x9d from the carrier. Most are benign like TikTok and Amazon Shopping, but others are ad-riddled news apps and â\\x80\\x98gachaâ\\x80\\x99 games, which are initially free but quickly start to offer in-app purchases. Make sure youâ\\x80\\x99re not just blindly clicking through the setup process, and youâ\\x80\\x99ll be fine.This phone also features something of a relic: the 3.5mm jack. Weâ\\x80\\x99re not sure why wired audio has become a budget-phone-only commodity, but weâ\\x80\\x99re glad to see it where we can. Bluetooth 5.1 is present on the phone for power-efficient wireless listening if youâ\\x80\\x99re into it, but however youâ\\x80\\x99re listening, the audio experience is fairly standard.Phones are expensive these days, but OnePlus is offering up a great device that\\'ll blow away your expectations without blowing up your wallet. Performance on this phone was reliably strong. Whether youâ\\x80\\x99re playing games or navigating the UI, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t notice that youâ\\x80\\x99re using a mid-range phone. I just picked this up for $39 with a new metro plan. This little powerhouse is blazing passed the performance of my outgoing LG G8 Thinq! I am not a power user, so this pretty much has everything I need. I got over 500 Mbps down during several speed tests driving around my town. I had the ZTE Axon 7 in the past. This phone has significantly more refined UI than ZTE. It is not overloaded with bloatware. I don\\'t care about the camera or the lack of wireless charging. I am slightly bothered by the lack of IP water resistance rating. I will just be careful with it but that price point I really don\\'t care. Screw what the naysayers are writing. If you\\'re not a power user and would like a nice android for a super affordable price then just get it. If anything you can use this until you save up for a flagship and then end up with a really decent backup in the event you lose that $1500 device. I\\'m really glad that I gave OnePlus a chance. Easy to use screen.  A bit difficult to set up but still, very nice.  Good size and it works well.  Great for anyone who does not want to sign on to a contract with a carrier.  Intuitive and user friendly buttons.  The face recognition works but I have disabled it for now.  It is not as easy to set up as an Apple or Samsung, but it is doable even for the less tech-savvy.  The screen is bright and clear and easy to read. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know which model is which but Iâ\\x80\\x99m pretty sure they all suck pretty bad all the same. This is the worst phone Iâ\\x80\\x99ve owned ever in my life. Iâ\\x80\\x99m pissed off that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had to own this phone for the last year. Iâ\\x80\\x99m never going to buy a Nord phone ever again, thereâ\\x80\\x99s so many things that I hate about this phone that thereâ\\x80\\x99s too much to write. if youâ\\x80\\x99re a casual phone user maybe using your phone maybe five minutes a day like an 80 year old person. This phone might be OK for you other than that I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t recommend it for anyone . I added a photo to show which model I own. Nord needs to stop making phones or make them at least decent before releasing these POS to the public. And Iâ\\x80\\x99m also pissed off at Metro pcs for selling me this phone in their store. With the current price of smart phones being what it is, I\\'m shocked that this phone is so reasonably priced.  This thing is an amazing deal!The display is super bright and vivid.  It\\'s hard to imagine it could be much better.The fingerprint reader is quick to recognize my finger.The pictures seem pretty great.  I\\'m not a photographer, by any means, but they\\'re definitely good enough for me.  I can\\'t speak to the selfie cam.... I\\'m not a selfie taker.The phone charges crazy fast and the battery lasts pretty long.  I think I read that it lasts around 2 days, but I\\'m on my phone a LOT, so no phone battery is going to last ME two days... lol.  But it does seem pretty good.I haven\\'t noticed a lot of lag.  Any lag I notice is probably more attributable to my Wifi, not the phone.This is a super solid phone for the price.You know how once your car has a few scratches or a dent or two you\\'re less worried about it in the parking lot and can breathe a little easier?  Well, I\\'m being really careful with this phone, but given the price of it, I can breathe a little easier and not be constantly worried about it like I would if it were four times the price.  That helps me relax a bit.  Plus I don\\'t feel like I\\'m settling, so it\\'s a win win. I needed a phone with SIM card slot when I travel because my iPhone isnâ\\x80\\x99t unlocked and itâ\\x80\\x99s been pretty expensive to use it. This phone pretty basic in my opinion, affordable to use as unlocked phone but honestly camera and user interface just very average. So as far as secondary phone, absolutely but itâ\\x80\\x99s not my primary by any means. We also decided to graduate it in a year and our oldest son can start using it as I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be heartbroken if he loses it or damages it. Overall good affordable phone that will do job. So I\\'m coming off the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G (man, these phone names are wordy now). My general impressions of that phone were that it was a solid phone with a lightweight OS and fast hardware but that the phone had some inherent flaws.And this phone isn\\'t far off from that experience, but with the added bonus that it\\'s less than half the price, which boggles the mind. Most of the specs are bumped back as you\\'d expect, but you wouldn\\'t notice unless you\\'re a phone power user. For example, I can\\'t begin to tell you how surprised I was that the quality of the OLED panel is fantastic for a $300 phone.The main two bits I\\'d complain about are that the camera cluster is a step down from its big brother: it\\'s missing an ultra-wide, which isn\\'t a surprise. Its speaker is also downgraded, removing one speaker from its sibling. Of course, the 10 Pro didn\\'t have that great sound reproduction, so that\\'s not a real point of contention either.What I\\'m basically saying is, you get a lot of phone for $300. I didn\\'t necessarily think the 10 Pro was worth its weight, but the Nord N20 absolutely comes in swinging. For 300$ one plus nord N20 5g ready smartphone.is definitely a good deal.Phone has 6gb ram and 128gb expandable.I love the blue smoke color.its very sharp looking.Large 4500mah battery. It does not drain fast.i do installed quite a bit of apps on my phone and it doesn\\'t eats up battery quick.Fast charging 33W.The fingerprint does respond pretty quick. Which amaze me because my other phone lG brand is not so good and it does lag with the fingerprint recognition.Face unlock also is quick recognition even in dim areas.The camera of this phone is great in a minimalto well lit  environment. I tested taking pictures in kind of dim room and it does not capture kind of good pictures even with flash on a bit of downside there.but it doesn\\'t take away of what this phone has to offer when it comes to price and functions.my overall view to the price and functions of this phone? I would definitely recommend this to anyone.its a great mid range phone that can fit to anybody\\'s budget. 6gb/128gb. Yes worth it definitely!. Conclusion: OnePlus Nord N20 is an affordable yet impressive smartphone that can meet any user\\'s requirement at a great price point.â\\x80¢A 6GB RAM and 128GB StorageI could download many games and applications , but it still didn\\'t lag. On top of it, I could store all my precious memories on it without worrying about the storage getting full.â\\x80¢4500mAh BatteryThe battery of the OnePlus Nord N20 gives up to 1.5 days of use time without recharging. Also, the fast charging enabled to recharge of the device at a turbo speed in less than an hour.â\\x80¢A Large ScreenThe screen of the OnePlus Nord N20 is 6.43\". I have a great time watching my favorite TV shows and movies on it. It had a bright screen that beautified every scene I watched.â\\x80¢5G EnabledThe OnePlus Nord N20 is 5G enabled to keep up with the latest technologies.â\\x80¢Very good camera qualityI could take very nice pictures that are comparable with the more expensive phones. Maybe only a few advanced imaging features are missing which I don\\'t see a problem for a phone at this price range. I am using the N20 for fee days and I can\\'t found a problems with the device camera or performance. Build quality in my opinion better than the any other OnePlus device in this segment you feel quality and sturdiness when you hold the device also and don\\'t put case on it. Screen is very good with nice angles of vision. Battery last hours without recharge. Sound is good but not exceptional. And the camera wao I have the OnePlus 10 pro and compare with the N20 in some cases this take pictures with more clarity indoors. Obvious when you zoom the picture the 10 pro offer better details but overall I prefer the N 20 . In my opinion this is the best option in this range of price more phone than the galaxy A53 what is laggy phone and overpriced just for have a Samsung badge. The OnePlus Nord N20 has been available through a few carriers like T-Mobile since earlier this year, but they finally made an unlocked version available this week.  You\\'re still limited to certain carriers like T-Mobile, Google Fi, Mint Mobile, and a few others.  AT&T is supported, but only at 4G speeds.  And Verizon is not supported at all.  So make sure you\\'re using a compatible carrier before you order this phone.  I have been using T-Mobile for years, so all I had to do was move my SIM card from my previous phone to this one.  My primary phone is an iPhone 13 Pro Max, but I have been using a Google Pixel 4a with 5G as my secondary phone for a while.  This phone is replacing my Pixel.  The processor is about 10-20% faster than the one in my Pixel, but the AMOLED screen is much better.  Plus the phone is lighter and also has nicer cameras as well.  So this is definitely an upgrade for me.  It does not support wireless charging, but it does support 33W fast charging, which enables you to charge the phone very quickly when the battery is running low.  The 2 main disadvantages to this phone are the single speaker which produces average sound at best, and the fact that only one OS upgrade will be offered (Android 12).  I am not sure why Nord won\\'t commit to supporting Android 13 on this phone.  But for $300, you can\\'t have everything.  Despite a few shortcomings, this is probably the best phone you\\'re going to find for $300 or less right now.  I recommend it highly.  Just be sure to get a good case to protect it. We got this phone as a first phone for our 10 year old daughter. We were looking for something inexpensive because we knew that there was a FAIRLY good chance it\\'d get broken.The phone was a pleasant surprise, It preforms amazingly well! Battery life is great, and recharge times are fast.The cameras are decent- not nearly the quality of our iPhones, but good enough for most uses. My daughter LOVES taking pictures and video with hers.The processor is fast enough to keep up with her online games, which is pretty important for her since it\\'s one of the main things that she does with the phone.While it is an \\'off brand\\' there are still a lot of accessories available for it like cases, etc. and at a reasonable price.Overall, a great value and highly recommended. Fast WiFi. Big beautiful screen. Great for these older eyes. Thin. Lightweight. Definitely a huge step up from the Moto I was using. I\\'m comfortable recommending this for use with the GoogleFi or T-Mobile services. My Moto G Power lasted less than 12 months before it totally died.It kept rebooting until it was totally dead!Followed support\\'s instructions to do a hard reset.Didn\\'t work!  Had to by a new phone! This has to be one of the best deals you can get for $300. The touchscreen works great, it\\'s very responsive, and feels good to use. The AMOLED screen looks really sharp and well lit (Not as good as the flagships but they are sufficiently good). The 6GB of ram and Snapdragon processor makes everything load fast and runs smooth. It can run graphically intense games and apps with ease. The battery charges so fast and I can get almost a days worth of moderate use in 20 minutes when I\\'m in a hurry. The cameras are amazing for a phone of this price range and it\\'s mind blowing how much of an improvement these are compared to the old phones we had just 10 years ago. They don\\'t work as well in low light settings and its also missing some nice AI features on iPhones and other flagship models but the picture quality is great overall. The build quality seems strong and it can survive some pretty big drops with a case and screen protector on it. It does everything you need and more for most people and it does it in a very affordable way. The only thing I can really complain about is the learning curve if you\\'re switching from an iPhone, but it was still pretty quick to learn. OnePlus Nord N20 5GI want give a shout out to this OnePlus Nord N20 phone. The performance is impressive at the level of $300 range. The fingerprint reader is especially helpful during the pandemic. Donâ\\x80\\x99t have any problems of playing most lightweight games and work great when playing videos.Charging time is short and the battery is durable. Not sure how long this will last, but so far itâ\\x80\\x99s all good as a new phone.The carriers are limited so please check if your carrier is supported. But otherwise if you are looking for an affordable phone you should definitely consider this! Very nice phone! Everything works great. Touch screen is nice and responsive! Highly recommend! It\\'s good to see name brands like OnePlus trying a little harder to make a budget phone with a competitive set of features and decent specs. Honestly, the lesser known brands are the ones that really tend to include a crazy amount of value on their $250-$400 devices, while more established brands (with names that people recognize), tend to include less for the price. This Nord N20 5G has virtually everything that a buyer could hope for at this price (assuming they are used to US pricing for smartphones and what tends to get included for $300). There are a few shortcomings on the OS/software side of the equation, and longevity is not this products strongpoint, especially when compared to a midrange device from Google or Samsung. They will give you 3-4 years of updates, or in the case of the upcoming Pixel 6a- 5 full years of updates.  Oneplus is only promising one update to get this phone on Android 12, but you will get 3 years of security patches in total, although, I am certain that they won\\'t be updated monthly, probably every 3-4 months. Even on their flagship phones, Oneplus only releases patches every 60 days or so. I think 2 OS upgrades would have been more fair, considering that this phone is already behind on its Android version.Now, let\\'s assume that you don\\'t care about or expect support in the way of security patches or OS updates. If that\\'s the case then everything else here is pretty good. The phone comes with 6.4\" Full HD+ AMOLED display, unfortunately there are no HDR capabilities here, it is an 8-bit panel only with support for sRGB and nothing else. So, it\\'s not really on par with an LTPO, 10-bit, 120Hz panel with support for HDR10+ and HLG. But, it is still AMOLED and has an excellent contrast ratio with deep blacks and vivid colors (when compared to an IPS LCD display on most phones that cost $300). One small plus is that this phone does support Widevine Level 1 encryption, so you can enjoy full HD content on Netflix and similar services. That feature is the first thing on the chopping block when you get down to this price point.The internal specs are also quite fair, you get a Snapdragon 695 (which consists of 2x Cortex A77/Gold p-cores and 6x Cortex A55/Silver e-cores) which is paired with 6GB of Ram( LPDDR4X running at 2133Mhz/16 bit dual channel). The 128GB of flash storage is UFS 2.2, so not as fast as the modern flagships, but not as slow as most phones at this price point which use eMMC. For people who are used to using flagship phones and the processing power of those devices, don\\'t disregard this because it has a Snapdragon 6-something instead of an 8-something. The CPU performance here is equal to a flagship phone from 2018-2019 (Snapdragon 845-855) although the GPU performance is a bit less and not equal to those older SoCs.I think that most people don\\'t come close to utilizing all of the computational power of their Android devices, even though they are paying extra to get it. If you don\\'t play intense mobile games, then there is really no good reason to get the best (or if you create content for a living and need the best camera performance). I really think the performance of the 695/Nord N20 5G is more than enough for the majority of mobile phone users.The camera situation is a little misleading, yes there are technically 3x lenses on the back of the phone, but only one of them is actually worth using. I really think this is a terrible habit that Oneplus has, putting useless 2 Megapixel sensors on the back of the phone so that it can market it as having a \"triple camera system\", when in reality, however much was spent on the macro and monochrome sensors would have been better used on just about ANYTHING ELSE. The primary camera is legit though, you get a 64 Megapixel main camera with autofocus (but without OIS). It\\'s capable of decent shots and the sensor itself is definitely good enough in my opinion, although it does suffer slightly from the lesser Spectra ISP. The image processing is just not as robust in midrange processors compared to flagship SoCs like the Snapdragon 888 or 8 Gen 1. I think that most people with be pleased with the results from the main camera, just don\\'t expect anything at all from the macro and monochrome sensors. One place that did get cut down was the ability to record video, you are limited to 1080p 30fps on the front AND the back. This seems a little crazy, you would at least expect 1080p 60fps, but I guess if someone really cares about videography on their smartphone, then they will be spending more than this on a device.The screen has an in-display fingerprint scanner, this is one benefit of using an OLED (as it wouldn\\'t be possible on an IPS panel). It feels as accurate as the one on my Oneplus 10 Pro, but it takes an extra beat to unlock. It\\'s also placed too close to the bottom (in my opinion), similar to the Oneplus 9/9 pro. It\\'s still a great thing to see on a $300 phone.Pros+6.4 inch, Full HD+ AMOLED screenIn-display fingerprint scannerWidevine Level 1 for Netflix and other servicesDecent Snapdragon 695 plus 6GB of RamUFS 2.2 storage speedHeadphone jack and Micro SD card slot33 watt fast charging wall adapter included in the boxCons-Released with a 1 year old version of Android and will only receive 1 OS version updateOnly one of the back cameras is actually worth usingVideo recording is limited to 1080p/30fpsNo Optical Image Stabilization on the main, 64MP cameraIt supports USB C power delivery, but I\\'ve had problems with some cables/wall adapters not charging the Nord N20 5G.

I will never use this phone and risk having to deal with this company again. OnePlus\\' Nord N20 5G is simply one of the best midrange phones on the market for Summer 2022.  Despite some flaws, it\\'s an extremely capable phone.  5 stars.I\\'ve had a couple OnePlus models over the years and share the frustration at the declining value proposition of the flagship models; compared to the early days, the high end stuff isn\\'t anything special at that price in comparison to other brands.  In fact, before I got this I was looking at a new old stock OnePlus 8 Pro as a replacement for a bricked phone; at half the original price, that seems to be the best option nowadays.  Their midrange models, though, still are pretty good - I have the Tmobile locked N200 - and this improves upon them significantly.  Incidentally, the N200 case won\\'t fit the N20 (the back camera lenses are a problem), but the screen protector works even with the front camera - and given the fragile plastic construction of the N20 I wouldn\\'t take this out of your house without putting both on.The two things I genuinely love about this compared to the N200 are the camera that at least brings it up to average quality (64 versus 48 MP, even if the other two sensors are largely useless and a dumb decision) and the fingerprint sensor being at the bottom of the screen with a much more natural unlock with your thumb versus on the power button of the N200.  This makes your decision to unlock far more logical, but I\\'d agree with their recommendation to do your fingerprints only *after* you put the screen protector on - made that mistake initially and then had to redo them all once I did!  I also like the headphone jack which the high end models now routinely eliminate.  And while 128 GB compares with the 10 Pro (which is bluntly not enough), the big advantage here is being able to use a micro SD card; this is something the flagships should have never taken out.But probably the biggest advantage to this phone is the SuperVOOC charger, which just cranks at 33 watts; this appears to require the actual charger included with the phone itself rather than any 65 or 100 watt one (which is frustrating) but it does charge from 50% to 100% within a half hour, making the already robust 4500 mAH battery feel far larger.  This is good because the battery does drain a bit between the OnePlus bloatware and not sleeping apps the way it should; OnePlus really wants you in their ecosystem and turning all the crap off (that dumb Device Detector feels like it\\'ll need a sideload to kill the request) is a problem; at least this version doesn\\'t include all the Tmobile junk.  Still, even with significant use you should get somewhere north of 12 hours, possibly more, on a single charge, and being able to crank it back up during the day with the 33 watt charger if you have it helps; I\\'m only a little concerned that it continues full bore and doesn\\'t trickle over 90%, which may cause problems with battery life.The screen is good; compared to a flagship you\\'ll notice the difference, but for the rest of us it\\'s perfectly fine watching 4k HDR, just not at high bit rate.  The processor upgrade to the 2.2 MHz Octo Core Snapdragon 695 and 6 GB of RAM pushes this from acceptable performance on the N200 to generally good on the N20; I don\\'t mobile game, but what I\\'ve been doing is running a whole bunch of extensions in Firefox and Chrome (via Kiwi Browser) that are desktop based like Alternate Player for Twitch.  On the N200 it was a noticeable performance hit doing so.  On the N20?  Doesn\\'t blink an eyelash doing so, and I\\'m really happy with its performance so far.The downsides?  The speaker is a mono one and not very good, and the fact we\\'re still waiting for Android 12 (guaranteed by OnePlus eventually) is a bit ridiculous, especially since Android 13 ain\\'t that far off.  I\\'m also not thrilled it\\'s only Bluetooth 5.1 and doesn\\'t support Wifi 6 and 6E; I get better speeds on 5G than I do on my home network.  Also, good luck rooting this for a few months; the process for the Tmobile locked version is still having problems, and I wouldn\\'t want to try anything else until things settle down quite a bit. The good news?  I\\'m using this on Mint and the configuration went through automatically without any effort on my part, and my 5G speeds on Tmobile\\'s network are impressive (even if the phone often wants to drop to 4G for power savings)The biggest drawback here is that as of this writing this won\\'t work on Verizon at all - and if you\\'re on AT&T, at present you\\'re currently limited to 4G, so this is really more of an Tmobile MVNO option (Mint and Google Fi) than a truly unlocked version for now.  As for competitors that some of the review sites throw out, are the Pixel 5A and Galaxy A53 better phones than the N20?  Arguably, but at \\'midrange\\' prices that are 50% more than this, those are now at price parity or even more expensive than new old stock flagship models from a couple years back; you\\'re probably better off looking at them instead.  For now, at this price point this is one of the best values on the market for a pretty darned good phone.  5 stars. For $299 this is a fantastic phone. You get a beautiful AMOLED screen, 6 gigs of RAM, and a snappy 695 Snapdragon processor. The camera is good with good lighting and it\\'s just one bottom firing speaker but those are reasonable compromises. It\\'s a joy to watch content on this phone and easy on the hand. The back is beautiful too. Budget phones sure have come a long way. Well worth getting for $299 or less. After looking around for cheap phones with great battery life I found this one. I\\'ve been very satisfied with it since I bought it in November. I\\'ve even dropped it a few times and no cracks or scratches. Also This phone is very speedy, almost no lag or wait times when loading pages or watching videos. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for an unlocked affordable phone. Great budget version of a flagship phobe for a great lower than flagship price. I was able to snag it for about $200! Expandable memory with micro SD card! Headphone jack and able to keep up with anything you need to do on it! Camera quality so far seems to be pretty great. Definitely no issues here. Bought it used \"good\" condition and it was like new, in the original box, with the original charger and everything! Would highly recommend this awesome budget friendly phone! I started with the iPhone 4 and just took my iPhone 7Plus out of service since Apple says it will not support iOS 16 or later.  Well, okay Apple...bye-bye.  So I moved to an Android platform; the OnePlus Nord N20 5G.  My FIRST Android mobile phone!  And yes, $230 feels much better than $700+ for a iPhone 14.  Ha, I have money left over to go purchase an Android watch.  I didn\\'t switch due to not liking my 7Plus; an Apple mobile phone is all I\\'ve used for 12 years.  It simply boiled down to limiting the out of pocket expense of replacing a mobile phone that was approaching end of life.I\\'ve been using the OnePlus for three days and I already like it.  Everything works smoothly; not one issue thus far.  I think with an attitude of \"give it a try,\" moving from Apple to Android shouldn\\'t be problematic for people.  Yes, ego and status can influence judgement.  The N20 operates a bit differently than my iPhone but the OnePlus is very capable and easily meets/exceeds my voice, texting, and photography needs....I\\'m not a \"power user\" by any means.  The Google Play store has all of the apps available that I had installed on my iPhone so I\\'m not having to deal finding alternatives.  Give me a couple of weeks to familiarize myself with the OnePlus and the operation will become second nature.  Just after three days, the iPhone seems \"clunky\" at this point.  Facetime and iMessages......so what!  The rest of my family will just have to deal with it.  Haha!If you happen to be a first time Android user and are looking for a great value the OnePlus Nord N20 should be on your short list.  Oh, I\\'m on T-Mobile.  New SIM card and 15 seconds later I was back in service. Shopping in $300.00 or less range for phones can be daunting but this phone really shines. It is definitely a big step up from my LG K20. Phone is sleek and OxygenOS is very nice to work with once you get used to it.Set up was easy and I was able to transfer most of my apps and data wirelessly between my old phone and the N20. I\\'m getting no dropped calls and texting is working well. I would have liked a better camera but this one works well for my purposes thus far.....I really haven\\'t used it much but it does function intuitively when taking pics. The phone updated to Android 12 on day one with no problems. Download speeds are insane and faster than my internet at home. With 6 gigs of ram and ram boost using the phone is very smooth. I haven\\'t loaded any games so I can\\'t speak to that right now. Battery life is excellent it charges very fast.In my opinion this phone is a very good value, it ticks all important boxes for me and has been trouble free to date. I don\\'t think you\\'d regret this purchase. Easy setup..long battery life..highly recommend...very fast 5g Love this smart-phone....does everything I want in a phone and does it flawlessly.  Extra long battery life as well.  Great value. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nÂ\\xa0Very Slick Excelente dispositivo, su funcionamiento y rendimiento son buenÃ\\xadsimos I can\\'t believe this phone only costs around $200.00.  This phone has features and performance of much more expensive phones.  I really don\\'t understand why anyone would need anything more.  We are T-mobile customers and last year T-moble replaced my wife\\'s old 3G flip phone with a one plus 200N phone, for free, and I was impressed.  This is a slightly updated phone from the 200N the main difference being 256GB memory and 6GB ram.  I highly recommend this phone especially for the price, it maybe the best $200.00 you ever spent. Just received my new OnePlus Nord N20 phone. Today bought this phone as an early black friday sale for two hundred twenty nine bucks (plus sales tax) and received it the same day, today, via amazon prime delivery. I was waiting for an expected (early) black friday price drop and therefore immediately ordered this beautiful phone. Upgrading from my older OnePlus Nord N10 which is still good but has been flaking out losing the 5G connection and had switch down to 4G LTE on the older N10. Anyways the new OnePlus Nord N20 looks fantastic and reminds me of the iPhone with the N20\\'s nice flat look and the nice flat side edges like on iPhone. The TouchID Fingerprint Reader built into the screen is a nice upgrade. And the screen quality looks very nice. Android 11 immediately updated and rebooted the phone. Everything else regarding android looks kinda the same as on my older N10 but is newly different on the N20 phone. Anyways if you know your phones and android, then you can say this phone is easy to set up as you want it.  The phone offered to copy (clone) everything from my old phone, but I\\'ll do that later after I put in a microsd card into this new phone. You can put a 512GB microsd card in this phone -- but I may end up putting only a 256GB microsd from my other (old) umidigi phone. This new phone also offered to set up my credit card in Google Pay -- and therefore that means the new phone\\'s NFC works. And taking a quick snapshot with this phone\\'s camera indicates the camera takes very nice sharp pictures.  Well, so far I\\'m very happy with this new OnePlus Nord N20 phone, but I still have to complete migrating (cloning) all my stuff from my old N10 after putting in the microsd card and then give this phone a few days of my playing with it. I\\'m expecting no problems -- because a phone is a phone. And this is a nice beautiful phone. Feels quality made and very sturdy. A warp charger power adapter and USB-C cable are included with this phone. There is an instruction pamplet and a sim card pin is also included. There is no case/cover included -- but this phone is too beautiful and shouldn\\'t be covered up. So I\\'m very impressed and very satisfied with this new OnePlus Nord N20 phone. Highly recommend this phone. Thanks Amazon!=======P.S. UPDATE: okay took me a couple/few days to to fully set up my new OnePlus Nord N20. used the Clone Phone app to transfer apps/data from my old OnePlus Nord N10 to my new OnePlus Nord N20. then had to rearrange all of my 350+ app icons, shortcuts, widgets onto eight separate homescreens, including the need to recreate dozens of shortcuts/widgets, then had to log in everything etc etc etc. anyways that all was a lot to sort through and took a couple/few days -- but you know it feels so good to get your phone set up the way you exactly want it to be.oh, one annoying concern was setting up the APN if you have TELLO as your carrier provider to get a cellular 5G data connection. if you have Tmobile, just insert your sim card and your phone should work right away. but for TELLO, i\\'ve tried a couple of APN settings. here\\'s Tello\\'s prescribed simple APN setting:name: TELLOapn: wholesaleand here\\'s a Tello \"fast\" APN setting which was stable for a while for me:Name: TELLO FASTAPN: fast.t-mobile.comMMSC: http://wholesale.mmsmvno.com/mms/wapencMCC: 310MNC: 240APN type: default,supl,ia,mms,xcapAPN protocol: IPv4APN roaming protocol: IPv4this is actually similar to the default APN for tmobile (T-Mobile LTE) except the different MMSC and APN Type lines. HOWEVER, changing the APN did not permanently stablize the cellular 5G data connection for me -- meaning still kept losing internet when switching from WIFI to NO WIFI.So, for now, i had to resort to switching down to using only 4G LTE to maintain a stable cellular data connection because i am on TELLO. therefore set Preferred Network Type to 4G/3G/2G (auto). so no stable 5G data connection on TELLO currently. this is the same problem on both my old N10 and on my new N20 also. anyways after looking for solutions (or explanations) when reading reddit posts, seems like this tello 5G problem has been happening since June 2022 and may affect other MVNOs also? oh well, may eventually want to go back to real Tmobile (maybe get a Tmobile Connect plan?) or get on Metro-by-Tmobile to get a real tmobile 5G data connection.otherwise, one other good important thing worth mentioning is the NFC on this N20 phone does indeed work for using Google Pay. no real trouble there. but since this is a new phone, had to reconfirm my visa cards as they were already in my Google Pay but now using on this new N20 phone. and, yes, it worked when i went shopping and paid for my purchase tapping my phone at the checkout register. yay! it works!but one annoying have-to-live-with-it change on the N20 (compared to the N10) is you cannot specifically minimize notifications to a single line  -- some notifications will automatically minimize to a single line if you select to silence (\"Set as silent\") the notification BUT others cannot be specifically miminized to a single line. me thinks this change is from the new influence of the OPPO ColorOS on OnePlus OxygenOS because the Android/OxygenOS 11 on the N20 is somewhat different (modernized???) when compared to what 11 is on N10.another noticeable change is the print dialog which takes up more of the screen with buttons, but if you want to print to a PDF file, press the triple dots in the right top corner of the print dialog to get the Save As PDF prompt.and yet one other annoying omission which is easy to fix is with the onscreen keyboard which may NOT have a pointer (arrow) for you to press at the bottom of the keyboard to disappear the keyboard. just install an addtional new keyboard, such as the microsoft swiftkey keyboard, from the google play store, and you should be able to continue to use the default Gboard keyboard with an added/restored pointer < below the botton row of the keyboard for you to press to disappear the keyboard.one last good thing to mention: the lift-to-wakeup ambient display does give you the TouchID to press to open the phone. that\\'s nice and handy when you pick up your phone. but you may want to make sure to turn off the Always-On Ambient Display to save on battery.anyways, so far after a few more days, got my new phone working the way i want it to work.=======P.S.S. NOV.30.2022 UPDATE: my OnePlus Nord N20 got an automatic UPGRADE UPDATE to Android12 OxygenOS12. the homescreens are a bit different including how shortcuts appear on screen and how you cannot put shortcuts in folders nor in the dock. well the new Android/OxygenOS 12 actually wiped out all my shortcuts and widgets -- and therefore have to recreate them all over AGAIN. so, i installed Nova Launcher to be able to have much more normal homescreens with the flexibility to put icons and shortcuts together including inside folders and on the dock. and that means i have to rebuild all my homescreens again. sigh. it\\'s nice to get Android 12 on my phone, but the new Oppo-ColorOS-influenced OxygenOS 12 launcher really sucks if you like to customize your homescreens. so, my suggestion is install the Nova Launcher from the Google Play Store.... ALSO, back to my situation with the TELLO 5G cellular data internet connection, looks like i could switch to MINT Mobile which i\\'m testing and looks like MINT has much more stable 5G. however, the new Android12 OxygenOS12 does give me hope to maintain a stable 5G while on TELLO because in the Developer Options, can go to 5G Network Mode and switch only to NSA Mode.  Apparently, according reports on Reddit, if it connects to SA mode, TELLO has problems connecting to 5G. so for now, as i would like to still stick with TELLO on this OnePlus Nord N20 5G phone, i\\'ll go with only the NSA Mode for 5G and hope nothing else breaks. I\\'ve had this phone for 6 months and I love it. Plus it\\'s only 1/3 what an iPhone costs. Love how it fits in my hand, slim not a brick.  Excellent battery life, and the 33w fast charger is no joke. The OLED screen is so crisp, camera takes decent pictures,  The fingerprint scanner and face recognition is excellent, so accurate and fast.  I\\'m still exploring, but so far I love it. Easy to use Read the reviews on how good a deal this was in terms of what you get for your money, and cannot disagree. I Like This Phone Bought this for my son. He says itâ\\x80\\x99s fast, works great. He seems to really like it Really snappy and decent camera. Finger print works ok. Package was really nice. My son bought this model because it was a good value.  Camera not the greatest but gets the job done. Screen is nice, specs are good, battery life good. Es rÃ¡pido buenas opciones de fotografÃ\\xada y cumple con todo lo prometido ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 I was surprised when I found out that this had an in-screen fingerprint reader. All my previous phones had one on the back. Andi it works fine FOR ME, I don\\'t know how good it is at preventing others from trying to open it with their prints. Try asking someone on the street: \"Hey, could you put your thumb on my phone here, please?\" I\\'d get locked up in no time, right?This is my first time owning a 5G capable phone and I\\'m impressed so far. I use Mint and it seems more responsive, and on my last 4G phone, it couldn\\'t get non-wifi internet access, but with this one I can. I don\\'t know why (don\\'t bother asking Mint that since Reynolds is too cheap to have even off-shore support). I\\'m not a \"smart phone\" person and don\\'t do any of the social stuff, but the phone is handy.It runs it own flavor of Android 12, with \"private\" tweaks much like the others, especially Samsung. It\\'s done two updates so far, one right after turning it on for the first time, then another a few weeks or so ago. I\\'ve had no operational issues. It does a better job of not draining the battery when I leave it in standby overnight, so I suspect that some of my apps on the other phone were \"running in the background\" and eating up the battery. This phone has a monitor that checks apps to see if they are eating the battery, and I got notifications about that. I was surprised when I started seeing my text messages on my PC screen (my 65\" Samsung living room TV) after \"bonding\" by phone to the PC via Microsoft\\'s latest effort to be more responsive to people\\'s needs to integrate their phones and PCs. Nice.This also has way faster Bluetooth download speeds than any other phone I\\'ve had yet. They all claim to be 5.0, and my PC is the same (e.g. no upgrades in the WiFi/Bluetooth area), but it\\'s faster. I mostly use that interface to download phone pics or videos for emailing that I do on my PC.The camera is OK. It often find out that my focus was off, once I download a pic to the PC. I\\'m not sure why, but I\\'ve always struggled with phone cams. It sucks that you get really hires pics and they\\'re not in focus. The phone also doesn\\'t compress the image much (e.g. original is 10MB or so and when I use Irfanview to \"save\" an image without cropping, it\\'s less than 2MB). Instead of buying this straight from T-Mobile for 300+ dollars, I got it on Amazon for a 50 dollar price markdown. I don\\'t regret it. For 250 dollars, you get not a FAST phone, but definitely a very RESPONSIVE phone: opening apps is relatively quick, web browsing is fluid and snappy, the screen gets nice and bright (to me), and there\\'s JUST enough power in the SOC (Snapdragon 695/Adreno 619) for some moderate gaming on the side. In my personal tests, older games like PUBG and Crossout Mobile get 60 FPS easy, more intensive games like Genshin Impact can hit 30 FPS, with an occasional stutter.The cameras aren\\'t that great, in my opinion, but that could be my awful photography skills. The speaker, however, gets nice and loud, and since my car doesn\\'t have bluetooth I can appreciate a loud speaker.I really hate the SIM/SD tray. Everybody does. We\\'ve really gone backwards with how we handle mobile phone expansion - just let us take off the back cover!All in all, solid value, and I\\'m very happy with it. I have had a Moto Z Play on Republic Wireless for five years. In 2022, it was still supporting the basic stuff (calls, messages, music, navigation, videos, and browsing), and the battery was in good shape. But, they ended support for WiFi calling on this device. Now I am running the Nord N20 5G on Mint Mobile.It\\'s similar in size, has the same near-stock android interface, exceptional battery life, crisp AMOLED display, lag-free Snapdragon 6 Series Platform, adequate camera, and limited OS upgrade support. Obviously, the processor is faster (Geekbench score of 2000 vs 500), the screen is larger (6.4\" vs 5.5\") and slightly brighter (461-647 nits vs 371-526 nits), the camera is sharper (64 MP vs 16 MP), the connectivity is better (faster WiFi, more 4G bands, and even a few 5G bands), and the OS is more recent (android 11 and 12 vs android 7 and 8). It was also 35% less expensive than the old phone ($275 with tax vs $435). And the new MVNO carrier is less expensive.The phone comes with a 33 watt charger and a USB-A to USB-C connector. It does not includes a case or screen protector. There is a tiny bit of bloatware, but it\\'s easy to remove. The OxygenOS is easy to setup so that it feels like stock android. The finger print sensor and face unlock work very well. My only grip is that the WiFi sometimes connects to my slower 2.4 GHz channels instead of my 5 GHz channels. I actually have three 2.4 GHz channels and four 5 GHz channels in my house, and they all have the same SSID. Unlike my other phones, the OnePlus seems to only show a preference for the strongest signal. I may have to rename my 2.4 GHz SSIDs to prevent this.The most stressful thing I did on this phone was to install Google Home and cast the screen to a Chromecast connected to my computer monitor. The Chromecast is hard wired to my network and my phone was connected to a 5 GHz WiFi channel with a bandwidth of about 300 Mbs. The phone performed very well. While playing a youtube video via the Chrome browser, the video and audio were in sync on the monitor. While scrolling through my Google feed, there was hardly any lag on either the phone or monitor.I have been testing this phone, on and off, for over 12 hours with about 4 hours of screen on time. The battery is at 67%. This is consistent with a battery endurance rating of 129 hrs on gsmarena, which is better than all of the iPhones and Galaxy S Series phones. For reference, the iPhone 13 max pro is rated for 121 hrs, and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G comes in at 114 hrs. Of course those phone are twice as fast, have a brighter 120Hz display, and much nicer cameras. But they also cost four times as much, and are running a bunch of extra processes that support all kinds of extraordinary features.If you want a mid-range phone, I would highly recommend this phone over the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G or Google Pixel 6a, both of which are about 30% more expensive. The A53 has descent battery life and better cameras, but is laggy and loaded with bloatware. The Pixel 6a has better cameras and a faster processor, but has poor battery life, is buggy, and even overheats. These other two phones will get more android upgrades, but these upgrades will most likely result in future issues with the phones. The only alternative that I would recommend to this phone is the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE, but only if you can get it new for $400. For under $250 (as paid on sale), this is a very impressive phone. AMOLED display and Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU to boot. The camera, as expected, is junk, but let\\'s be honest- you didn\\'t really expect a good camera at this price point. The phone is built really well and even looks high-end despite its plastic body. The only thing I wish it had was at least some level of water-resistance (there\\'s no IP rating).I was choosing between several Motorola models, including Stylus 5G and OnePlus N20 was a clear winner on paper because of OLED display. It also has very fast (33W) charging via USB PD. Seems Motorola has gone downhill in the last few years since its impressive G5 Plus released 4-5 years ago, especially so when it comes to OS updates- with only one major OS version update promised by the company. Granted, OnePlus has a similar policy and the N20 should only be updated to Android 12 (already updated), although the company allegedly promised Android 13 for N20, so will have to wait and see.I did debloat the Oxygen OS from all useless OnePlus crap, not to mention malware and spyware \"packaged\" with the phone. Adb is your friend here and rooting isn\\'t needed. Now I have an almost pure Android phone that looks good and performs well. Sorry, Motorola- you lost the cheap smartphone game to the Chinese... This is a great phone for the price!  The OS is pretty clean and the phone is quite fast.  I\\'m writing this review to point out some important caveats:1. T-Mobile is the only carrier that fully supports this phone (5G and WiFi calling).  AT&T only supports it at 4G and they don\\'t support WiFi calling on it.  Verizon doesn\\'t support this phone at all.2. Many OnePlus phones, including this one, don\\'t properly support Google Voice integration with the native phone app when Android v12 is installed.  All calls from the phone app will go out over the carrier pathway, regardless of what you\\'ve configured in the Google Voice app.  This has apparently been an issue since January 2022 and OnePlus doesn\\'t appear to have any plans to fix it.If those issues don\\'t impact you, then this phone is a far better choice than similarly priced phones from Samsung and Motorola due to the performance, features, and security patch support. Just love the OnePlus Nord N20 phone ð\\x9f¤³ for it is fast and fingerprint and face sensors are too and battery life good and such a pretty design.  My only issue is cannot access any other drives to choose photos to set as desktop and cannot set photos as desktop direct from other drives.  Maybe I should use another launcher and not use the Home Launcher. I\\'ve used it a couple of months now. I\\'m pretty happy. It took a little getting used to as it\\'s a different operating system, but it\\'s not too complicated. I like how all my Google apps work great on it. I don\\'t use any of the OnePlus apps, they seem like a waste of space. Reception is decent and camera works well. No glitches :) This phone took 3 calls to my carrier to get it to be completely usable. It was not fully unlocked. So far I like the responsiveness of this phone. Too many features for me though. There is a chat feature with security codes already enabled upon set up for encryption of texts...I suppose for sensitive info but annoying for me. Spent a ridiculous amount of time turning off these kinds of things and all the notifications I didn\\'t want. When I transferred my data from my old phone the pics and pics in texts did not transfer....and mms messages were not downloading. Ugh. another call to change something else within the interior workings of the phone andd now everything seems to be good. No complaints on the screen, fonts, etc... Received and returned it on the same day. Even though it\\'s described as \"U.S. Unlocked\", it doesn\\'t work with T-Mobile/Sprint, so I couldn\\'t activate it.  Had to go back and buy it from my carrier.  Now I â\\x9d¤ï¸\\x8f it.  Nice feel, big screen, 6 GB RAM expandable to 11 GB if unused memory is available.  My apps flow flawlessly on my 5G network, loaded up everything off my old Moto G6 and all performance issues are behind me.  Blazing fast charging, even on other than the 33w charger that came with it.  Excellent battery life.  Camera works fine; I\\'m not Ansel Adams.  But buy a case for it, the lenses sticks out a bit.  My case has a sliding cover for them so when not in use they\\'re well protected.  Buy this phone, just check with your carrier first to make sure they can activate it. Large screen, high resolution, the system is steady even when opening multiple apps, charging very fast.  It\\'s my best choice after comparing with other cell phones with the same price. I was surprised when I found out that this had an in-screen fingerprint reader. All my previous phones had one on the back. Andi it works fine FOR ME, I don\\'t know how good it is at preventing others from trying to open it with their prints. Try asking someone on the street: \"Hey, could you put your thumb on my phone here, please?\" I\\'d get locked up in no time, right?This is my first time owning a 5G capable phone and I\\'m impressed so far. I use Mint and it seems more responsive, and on my last 4G phone, it couldn\\'t get non-wifi internet access, but with this one I can. I don\\'t know why (don\\'t bother asking Mint that since Reynolds is too cheap to have even off-shore support). I\\'m not a \"smart phone\" person and don\\'t do any of the social stuff, but the phone is handy.It runs it own flavor of Android 12, with \"private\" tweaks much like the others, especially Samsung. It\\'s done two updates so far, one right after turning it on for the first time, then another a few weeks or so ago. I\\'ve had no operational issues. It does a better job of not draining the battery when I leave it in standby overnight, so I suspect that some of my apps on the other phone were \"running in the background\" and eating up the battery. This phone has a monitor that checks apps to see if they are eating the battery, and I got notifications about that. I was surprised when I started seeing my text messages on my PC screen (my 65\" Samsung living room TV) after \"bonding\" by phone to the PC via Microsoft\\'s latest effort to be more responsive to people\\'s needs to integrate their phones and PCs. Nice.This also has way faster Bluetooth download speeds than any other phone I\\'ve had yet. They all claim to be 5.0, and my PC is the same (e.g. no upgrades in the WiFi/Bluetooth area), but it\\'s faster. I mostly use that interface to download phone pics or videos for emailing that I do on my PC.The camera is OK. It often find out that my focus was off, once I download a pic to the PC. I\\'m not sure why, but I\\'ve always struggled with phone cams. It sucks that you get really hires pics and they\\'re not in focus. The phone also doesn\\'t compress the image much (e.g. original is 10MB or so and when I use Irfanview to \"save\" an image without cropping, it\\'s less than 2MB). Instead of buying this straight from T-Mobile for 300+ dollars, I got it on Amazon for a 50 dollar price markdown. I don\\'t regret it. For 250 dollars, you get not a FAST phone, but definitely a very RESPONSIVE phone: opening apps is relatively quick, web browsing is fluid and snappy, the screen gets nice and bright (to me), and there\\'s JUST enough power in the SOC (Snapdragon 695/Adreno 619) for some moderate gaming on the side. In my personal tests, older games like PUBG and Crossout Mobile get 60 FPS easy, more intensive games like Genshin Impact can hit 30 FPS, with an occasional stutter.The cameras aren\\'t that great, in my opinion, but that could be my awful photography skills. The speaker, however, gets nice and loud, and since my car doesn\\'t have bluetooth I can appreciate a loud speaker.I really hate the SIM/SD tray. Everybody does. We\\'ve really gone backwards with how we handle mobile phone expansion - just let us take off the back cover!All in all, solid value, and I\\'m very happy with it. I have had a Moto Z Play on Republic Wireless for five years. In 2022, it was still supporting the basic stuff (calls, messages, music, navigation, videos, and browsing), and the battery was in good shape. But, they ended support for WiFi calling on this device. Now I am running the Nord N20 5G on Mint Mobile.It\\'s similar in size, has the same near-stock android interface, exceptional battery life, crisp AMOLED display, lag-free Snapdragon 6 Series Platform, adequate camera, and limited OS upgrade support. Obviously, the processor is faster (Geekbench score of 2000 vs 500), the screen is larger (6.4\" vs 5.5\") and slightly brighter (461-647 nits vs 371-526 nits), the camera is sharper (64 MP vs 16 MP), the connectivity is better (faster WiFi, more 4G bands, and even a few 5G bands), and the OS is more recent (android 11 and 12 vs android 7 and 8). It was also 35% less expensive than the old phone ($275 with tax vs $435). And the new MVNO carrier is less expensive.The phone comes with a 33 watt charger and a USB-A to USB-C connector. It does not includes a case or screen protector. There is a tiny bit of bloatware, but it\\'s easy to remove. The OxygenOS is easy to setup so that it feels like stock android. The finger print sensor and face unlock work very well. My only grip is that the WiFi sometimes connects to my slower 2.4 GHz channels instead of my 5 GHz channels. I actually have three 2.4 GHz channels and four 5 GHz channels in my house, and they all have the same SSID. Unlike my other phones, the OnePlus seems to only show a preference for the strongest signal. I may have to rename my 2.4 GHz SSIDs to prevent this.The most stressful thing I did on this phone was to install Google Home and cast the screen to a Chromecast connected to my computer monitor.

Large screen, high resolution, the system is steady even when opening multiple apps, charging very fast.  It\\'s my best choice after comparing with other cell phones with the same price. I also like the headphone jack which I use daily. The screen is more than enough resolution for what you pay for. With the latest update you could use the memory to add ram. So now it officially has 12gb of ram. Never had a problem with multitasking. Warp charge is nice. It lasts me at least a full day with heavy use. I\\'m having problems with my connection though every time I change regions. I have to turn the data connection off and on again. This is on US Mobile. That\\'s my only grip and it may only be carrier related but I\\'ve had other phones on this carrier and never had that issue. Anyways I really hope phone makers are ditching the \"infinity\" display for once and for all. That would be great. First off I would like to say I am really enjoying this phone.  The upgrade to Android 12 came with some great features that my old \"Android 12 Phone\" didn\\'t have.  The camera on this phone seems to get a bad rap in the reviews but it is prefectly adequate for day to day use.  I\\'m not a professional and it certainly fills my needs and has a whole host of cool features you can toggle into and use.  The display is crisp and the phone is fast and simply works well.  The battery life is for every and will easily stand two days of use.  I do not lock my phone so I can\\'t comment on the \"facial recognition or finger print reader\".  But the OS upgrade brought this great phone alive with some interesting features.  The phone also has a magnetometer and accelerometer built in that I really love for a couple app\\'s I like.The only criticisim I would have for the phone is the ring tones and notification tones could be much louder.  But for music or video the volumn is fine.  I had called OnePlus about this and they said that I could download louder ring tones and I did this and it did make a difference but this is the very first phone that I didn\\'t have to modulate the ring tone and notification tones.But other then that tihs is a wonderful device. Excelente equipo me siento satisfecho con la adquisiciÃ³n, solo que aveces se pone un poco lento, el reconocimiento de huella a veces no me funciona bien pero en cuanto a relaciÃ³n calidad precio y funcionabilidad es excelenteLo volverÃ\\xada a comprar Bought this one for my girlfriend, it\\'s been 2 months. It works pretty good, the battery seems not as good as I was expecting. Popped my Mint mobile sim card in... connected the second it finished booting up... Just updated to android 12, everything works great for me... phone has more features: tap to wake, raise to wake, more always on display setting. Great little device for $248 after tax. 33 watt fast charge, more like 30 watts for the first %6 lol. the fast charging is fine, but just like advertised \"charge speeds\" 33 watts even with the original charger is a \"theoretical max\" not what the rate is even for the first 25%. honeslty, it feels high end, like a real gaming phone. I would say it can easily compete with the Razer Phone 2 it had when it was new. Good refresh rate, and I was not aware of how many cool features the Nord phones have! I\\'m a big fan now! Packs a lot of power for the size and the battery Last a lot! I play a lot and it doesn\\'t heat at all. the interface is *chef kiss* I am going to make sure that my next phone is also a Nord too As of now it\\'s working as expected. Don\\'t expect alot of bells and whistles. It\\'s got all the Android features you\\'d expect in a low budget phone. Alot and I meand alot of tips and videos on YouTube will help you with the phone. It\\'s not a multitasker phone. Does not I repeat does not come with a music player. Or wireless charging. Read up before you buy so you know what you would have this for. I have multiple phone lines so this is my spam caller line for business. Personal no I\\'ll stick to anything else. But a great back up phone for now. Battery is ok so long as you tone down certain things. Quick charge and I suggest from what I\\'ve read only use the charger it came with and your battery will be fine. If you want to make this your everyday. All in all not bad for the price. And all the extras like case and screen protector are cheap when you get it. So that\\'s a plus. If anything goes wrong I\\'ll update. But go for it if you\\'re thinking of buying. Does the job and is decent mid-range value phone. Worked just fine for me on TMobile & second phone on myfamilymobile (TMobile).I am just a average phone user just use a handful of the common apps. Phone does what I need more than well enough.I was longtime Moto user but didn\\'t like latest models in this price range plus the screen size was getting too big. What made me choose was AMOLED screen & 5g, and not oversized screen size. Also it immediately updated to Android 12.Only cons I have are a few Android 12 or OnePlus UI features & customizations nit-picking. And I miss having dedicated fingerprint reader.I got it on sale at $230 which is good purchase. But at full 300 price I would just buy something else since that is not really value price It\\'s just a great laptop for which you pay a good price. Money well spent. I use it for app development and it performs very well I changed from a TCL 10l to a Nord N200 5G. I had an issue originally with the app switcher (right ð\\x9f\\x94³ on 3 button nav bar) not working, even after factory resetting. They continued to work with me to resolve the issue and eventually escalated it to the devs, who also were great with communicating (and honest about not knowing what the issue is after a lot of troubleshooting, but would keep investigating).It turns out my prefered launcher that automatically installed at setup was the issue. I had to uninstall/reinstall the launcher and app switcher works. Uninstall/reinstall an app has resolved most of my issues. Now everything is working great and the battery lasts a long time even when playing games.The single speaker isn\\'t great but at this price level corners get cut. It has updated to Android 12. Camera is great, battery lasts all day, fingerprint sensor reads much better than my last phone, phone material feels great in the hand, got a case from Amazon, & Amazon let me pay in 4 without applying for a credit card. With Crickets service, Nord N20 ($230) is more favorable to my Moto G Stylus (2021, $145) that I gave to my son.  Speed is OK (2.2GHz, same as MOTO).  4G connection (no 5G supported) is reliable and clocks in around 40Mbs while a home WIFI is used a lot.  Battery lasts a whole day.  AMOLED screen is better.  Nord is light to carry.  Less apps also come installed.  Overall, I like it due to the screen, lightness and less junk apps.  BTW, I play no games, so I don\\'t know about those, only about Internet (YouTube, Facebook, shopping), texting, phone service and overall daily activities.  Plus, I wait for so long for AMOLED to come down near 2 Benjamin\\'s.  Any companies out there can beat this price with this type of screen?  NONE... Works well with few issues. Fingerprint reader can be hit or miss. Despite of very low price for that product it turned to be a real underdog!The only issue - it is the rear camera. It\\'s poor... Phone is great good features does everything I needed to do except! I cannot connect multiple bluetooth speakers which is the only reason I bought this model because it has Bluetooth 5.1 but I guess I should have did more research because it\\'s Bluetooth 5.2 that has that option otherwise great phone. I use a phone for phone calls, texting, playing music in the car, and occasional web browsing.  This phone does the trick.  I don\\'t play games on the phone or watch movies so my graphics and processor demands are limited.  The camera is adequate for snapshots.  The second tier 5G capability is a nice to have although I found 4G adequate for my needs.  The hardware test was the browser front end for a Raspberry Pi music streamer.  My previous phone couldn\\'t run it.  I think it was memory bound and the additional 2 GB made the difference in response time.  The only con for me is that it\\'s a bit narrow making the landscape display too small in the vertical direction.  I have larger than average hands so I\\'m not at the human factors mid point.  I hope not to replace it for several years. For the price, this phone is a step up from my old Galaxy S8 and Xcover pro. Apps run smoothly without lag and the processor is fast to where it can do anything I throw at it. The 4500mah battery lasts me the whole day and although I\\'m missing the 60fps on cameras, 30fps isn\\'t so bad either. I don\\'t play games so I don\\'t know for sure how it will perform with the Adreno 617 but I\\'m guessing it\\'ll perform fairly well. For $300, 6GB ram, 128GB storage, and a big battery really, this makes the best bang for the buck phone. There have also been no problems that I have encountered since the purchase of this phone.Update October 6th: The phone has zero issues and I have since bought another one for my father as a gift and he seems to enjoy it over the company phone he received.Update November 2nd: The phone is still one of the best upgrades that I have gotten myself and my father. There is no issue with the phone and I still use it daily. One of the things that is really useful is that I don\\'t have to worry about not having enough ram to run youtube in small-picture mode while browsing chrome, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, or reading manga on Tachiyomi. The main complaint I had about my s8 or Xcover pro was not having enough ram to multitask while having youtube open (picture in picture mode). Now, every time I check my ram usage while using youtube and browsers, I have at least 1.8GB or 2GB of ram ready in reserve and it helps a lot.Update Dec 9: Recieved the android 12 update and so far, no issues at all with the new OS. I am also guessing that android 12 will be the final update since the support page has stated that updates/security support will last until the start of 2023 (probably will end near April of 2023). This Nord 20 is great, just what I was looking for. I have always liked Motorola phones, but this has better features, like up to date software and upgrades. The battery seems good so far, lasts awhile. So far, I am very happy with this phone. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nÂ\\xa0This phone was purchased in like new condition. It showed up two days after purchase. It looks brand new updated to the newest version of iOS. Iâ\\x80\\x99m coming from an iPhone to an android again so far this phone is really good. It feels nice in your hand. Picture quality is, really good seamless gaming videos are fine face recognition and fingerprint sensors work well downside is speakers could be better, but it does the job Iâ\\x80\\x99m working off of cricket wireless this is an unlocked phone. Everything seems to be working out so far so good. I\\'ve had more expensive phones but this is by far the best phone I have bought it does everything I need I would suggest getting a micro SD card to store your music and videos but overall it\\'s awesome I love this phone especially the price I got it for Great price. Surprised of all the memory it has. Whats the deal here? TMobile sells this phone yet the one I purchased from Amazon does not or cannot be used on TMO.  I first called Amazon but they could not help me on the phone. Then I called Sprint/TMO, same deal. Went to the store and thats when they told me it can not be used on the TMO network, what? So if I purchase it from them its okay? Purchase from someone else, NOT gonna work.  This may just be the start of something new that maybe the attorney general should know about.  So be aware if you are a sprint/tmo customer do not purchase this phone. So far the first week I\\'m enjoying it. It\\'s a different phone for my last one and it\\'s taking a little bit of getting used to but overall it seems fast and that\\'s when I need. I like everything about the phone except for the battery life. It\\'s seem to deplete as fast as my 3 year old phone that I replaced with this one. I probably exchange for a different model. I like it\\'s performance and look Gran Calidad y excelente precio Print I\\'d is glitchy. I was kinda scared because I read it was unlocked but for US ONLY on the description, Iâ\\x80\\x99m currently living in Ecuador and it was a gift for my mom.Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad to say the phones working fine, it was easy to set up, I like how light it is compared to the old Samsung my mom had.I strongly advice you do the fingerprint scan before putting a screen protector on. Itâ\\x80\\x99s kinda tricky to get the fingerprint the correct way!Facial recognition works just fine.Battery life is pretty good, considering she only uses the phone for social networks and games.Pretty happy with the buy! On my old phone, a full workday would leave me at about 30% or less by five. That means any dates, outings, or even just chill time after work would need one of those portable power blocks or a quick recharge beforehand.Now, my phone might, just might be down to 70% at the end of my work day. That\\'s just amazing. Its so freeing to not need to watch my battery like it\\'s my life any more.Beyond that, it\\'s also super light weight, smaller than my old LG Stylo 6 (I consider it a plus since it doesn\\'t fall out of my pocket so much), and much, much faster. The stats on the phone is nice. The battery charged full in about 30 minutes and lasts all day even when I\\'m streaming. I\\'m disappointed in the front camera it\\'s blurry but other then that no problems So far this phone has been pretty dang great, I work for a cleaning company and we have to use an app for our service to clock in etc so I do find that it tends to use a bit more battery but it still last all day, I previously used Motorola brands I will never go back to them again. It has amazing cameras both front and back camera take beautifully stunning photos!!! Times the touch screen can be a little bit laggy but also I think that that could be my phone service just being an a pain!! Overall I\\'m very very happy with it definitely worth the price it\\'s unlocked however if you do try to use straight talk it will not work because straight talk is now only  Verizon towers and this is unlocked for GSM only! The OnePlus 2 was my first phone from their brand. I was extremely ecstatic with the direction One Plus was going in. The OnePlus 3 was my last phone, as soon as the OnePlus 3T came out they had moved in the direction of other major players in the market. They were overcharging for their devices and making incremental changes to sell a new phone.  With the release of this phone and my unhappiness with my recent Google Pixel 6 Pro, I decided to try OnePlus again. I am extremely happy with this phone. It\\'s not like the old days when you bought a mid-range phone and you lost access to a lot of important features.  Frankly, this phone feels more responsive than my Pixel was, mostly because the 5G antenna is so much better.  I get 5G with this OnePlus phone where I wouldn\\'t even get 4G on my Pixel.  Long story short, it\\'s worth every penny.  Check the features before you buy it to make sure there\\'s nothing you can\\'t live without, but the only thing that I found most people probably won\\'t like is the lack of wireless charging.  Other than that, I\\'ve been extremely happy. Really like the ability to run 5G speed and in my area see 300+ Mb/s speeds. Use a screen protector and case on the phone and it is set for normal use. Camera function is good for close in shots but only has 6X magnification for distance. Battery life is good, my experience is daily it drains to 75% before charging back to 100% over night. BTW, I use a timer of 90 minutes to charge the battery. Even though the phone controls the charging, to stop the possibility of overcharging. It might extend battery life. As always OnePlus does it again. By far the best phone brand I have ever owned. Out preforms the other name brands time and time again. For three quarters of the price. If you\\'ve never owned one, you need to. The product does not contain clear information that it has only one sim card and one SD (memory) card. It also does not have an opportunity to add a virtual card of the second sim card. So if you want a cellphone with more than one sim card, this cellphone is not the option you look for. It would be great to have this clear information in the product description. For the price, this is the best phone on the market right now. Beautiful, fast and a good battery. The speakers are awesome; loud and clear.I do not usually like Android-based operating systems, but I cannot afford what Apple wants for phones and I am not willing to buy a phone without a headphone jack (this one has one, by the way). However, OnePlus has lots of really good system features and offers a good Android experience here. I love their file manager.The camera isn\\'t anything spectacular, but as someone who uses DSLR cameras, I don\\'t like to use a phone for anything spectacular anyway. This camera is more than fine for day-to-day family moments and the photos certainly are not ugly.The performance is not bad, either. I play games on it and have not had any lag issues. It\\'s a quality phone. I\\'m really glad I bought it. Awesome camera quality and outstanding battery life Excellent Bought this to replace my delicate and always breaking Google Pixel and I genuinely keep forgetting that it isn\\'t the Pixel because it is so nice. What a steal this phone is - I just wish I bought it first before dumping a ton of money into a junk product like the Pixel. That thing was so fragile that the guys at the UbreakIFix store all said they were notorious and they couldn\\'t keep parts in stock for it. I migrated from a LG K20 running Android 7 to this OnePlus Nord N20 5G 6 GB RAM 128 GB ROM because I needed new medical apps that require at least Android 8 and the LG had no updates available beyond 7. I immediately found that that the LG K20 was way more user friendly with way better function options. In spite of my OnePlus Nord N20 being 5G with 6gb RAM/128gb ROM, it has horrible phone connectivity issues that I didn\\'t have with my old Android 7. At arbitrary times during calls, my phone mic would quit or my phone wouldn\\'t transmit my voice, sometimes for minutes! The screen touch is far too sensitive, often activating functions that hadn\\'t been selected just because my finger or thumb were close. There seems to be no sensitivity adjustment anywhere. There is no wifi calling setting available to set my wifi calling preference, that I can find. I certainly wouldn\\'t recommend this phone to anyone. I\\'m researching what is involved in returning it. Bought to replace son\\'s Nord N10 with a broken screen (not usable) and was not disappointed. Easily transferred all info over within a few minutes and had it up and running. I was tired of paying a lot to get an AMOLED screen. I was glad that I waited to get this one from Amazon and not from T-Mobile so as to not get the locked T-Mobile bloatware.  Nord N20 appears to really have good 5G antennas as I get good coverage in all my areas on T-Mobile or maybe it is just frequency bands. The main thing you do on your phone is to look at the screen and this screen is excellent and you can see it with polarized sunglasses. I also like that you can select dark screen with icons and text lit which saves battery,  If you are on T-Mobile or one of its dedicated MVNOs you might consider this phone. Do your research. The phone has good speed, an excellent display, gets great reception with Mint Mobile and the fingerprint scanner is the best I have used to date. Battery life is great, checking an email /social media is fine, trying to watch videos including videos from my old phone are very choppy and jerky. Would not buy another one.11/30/22There was a big update and the video issues are corrected on my phone.  I tried a few different platforms and no issues.Now, I\\'d buy another one. I purchased this as a replacement phone for my sister who accidentally dropped her phone and killed it. She had a OnePlus 6 and the phone is leaps and bounds better than her old phone. Super fast and responsive plus a camera that rivals many higher end phones. The battery life is easily good for a day and a half and the recharge is twenty minutes from 20% to a full charge. We have been using OnePlus phones for about three years and have never been disappointed! I know it was only $200,but the camera is just barely good, and reaction time is very pokey.  Blue-tooth is slow to aquire, but OK after that.  A lot of the problem, I think, is because of battery optimization.  when I call up a game, that I was playing 5 minutes, it basically has to start up again.  This phone is merely a place holder I\\'m very happy with this phone. The Best way. This is a super solid phone that punches above it\\'s weight class.Pros:The best battery life I\\'ve seen in a phone. Definitely a 2 day phone.Beautiful screen.Build quality feels like a phone at least twice the price in the hands.Fingerprint reader is quick and accurate.Smooth and snappy, never felt sluggish.33w fast charging is super quick.Cons:No fast refresh screen.Only Android 11.Cameras are fine for it\\'s price, but this is where it shows it\\'s price.Overall a super solid phone. Danielstechstudio has a more in depth review on you tube, but this is my go to recommendation if you\\'re looking for the best budget phone out right now. Also very surprising that this is so good, seeing as the Nord n200 from last year was horrible. Great reception and good camera. Fingerprint works best of any phone I\\'ve had. I bought these to replace 2 year old Moto G Powers (2020 model), which were fairly nice phones. These are much nicer and my triplet boys are very happy with them. They play games better, the fingerprint reader works way better than the one on my Google Pixel 6 Pro (which isn\\'t saying much, sadly). They do come with some crapware, which is annoying and I have no idea why that\\'s legal for an unlocked phone. I didn\\'t realize they had NFC, which was a nice bonus. One weird thing with the google family plan I haven\\'t figured out yet is that they don\\'t update the location very well. Probably a permissions issue. I bought this phone as a spare phone in addition to our more expensive iphones. This one exceeds my expectations for a entry level android phone as it is fast, well built and does not have much non-google UI stuff pre-installed that one needs to worry. The over response is snappy and the cam works fast and produces fairly high quality pictures. Lo bueno! Es un oneplus,lo malo! La cÃ¡mara, si buscas buenas fotos o videos este no es el dispositivoLo bueno! La carga,Lo malo! La resoluciÃ³n de pantalla y lo re malo el desbloqueo facial es pÃ©simo.Respecto al resto pues se mantiene en la media ni muy muy ni tan tan This phone is amazing for the price I paid. I needed to get an upgrade for my father in laws Moto Z3 Play. This thing is an actual â\\x80\\x9cupgradeâ\\x80\\x9d that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t break the bank. He uses Cricket Wireless which means no 5g but gets solid 4g coverage. Super fast, just seems to work.I bought him a Galaxy A53 5g and that things Bluetooth didnâ\\x80\\x99t work in his car! A quick Google search revealed itâ\\x80\\x99s a common problem with no known fix going back months. Thank heavens for amazons return policy and no restocking bull crap that companies like Best Buy try to pull. Will update if The phone has issues. So, I upgraded from OnePlus 7 Pro.A great phone BTW. Upgraded to Nord N 20 5G, pro\\'s and consPro\\'s,Great batteryGreat cell service connection, from my previous phone above.ConsOk Camera, however the older phone has much better camera.Slower phone tooSpace okSo if you are looking for Camera or speed, stay away,But if you just need great battery and connection go for it.And the price is great, I bought it during sale from Amazon. I absolutely love this phone. It\\'s responsive and has a lot of great features that my previous phone didn\\'t have. I got almost two full days on one battery charge. Pictures and camera are far better than the Samsung flip that this was replacing. Unfortunately, while it will work with AT&T for calls and text, it will not work for data. Apps will only work on Wi-Fi.  If you only use apps while on Wi-Fi then I can\\'t recommend this phone enough. But if you want to stream your music in your car or use apps like Waze and you have AT&T, forget it. I purchased this for my Mom (it works in USA/Nepal). This has quick charge, long battery life, great camera, amazing screen, and pretty snappy ... this is great value for the money I paid. I ran with the Nord N10 for 2 years before wanting an upgrade. I compared this phone to the Samsung A53, and for $50 more than the Nord N20 you get a while lot more, including:-120 Hz display (Nord N20 is 60Hz)-5000 Ma battery life (Nord N20 has 4500 Ma)-5G on AT&T (Nord N20 does not support it)-Android 12 (Nord N20 has 11, at the time of writing this there is no date for upgrade)-Better camera configuration and picture quality (One Plus cuts corners here massively)There are a few other negatives to this phone, but honestly other than the inscreen fingerprint reader, felt like a clone to the N10. Honestly expected much more from One Plus. Easy to use Awesome battery life. A nice change. Muy bueno se los recomiendo El telÃ©fono funciona muy bien. La baterÃ\\xada rinde mÃ¡s de 2 dÃ\\xadas sin cargar. Se carga en 1 hora aproximadamente de 0 a 100. Tiene cobertura 5g en todas partes con la red de Mint Mobile (T-Mobile). Funciona bien en juegos y no se calienta. La pantalla de se bien en todas condiciones y usando el modo oscuro. A pesar de todo eso lo tuve que devolver ya que le saliÃ³ un punto de pixel muertos en la pantalla. QuizÃ¡s sea un defecto de la unidad que comprÃ©. Por eso las 3 estrellas. Use this phone for couple days. The experience is not very good.There is no reason to crash twice,It\\'s not because the phone is too hot to crash.The normal use of mobile phones also frequently appears stuck. The power consumption of the battery is average, similar to my iPhone12.You get what you pay for, so you don\\'t need to expect too much for a mobile phone at this price. This is a decent phone. However, the loading time for the home screen is atrocious. It takes like 5-6 seconds to load and I\\'ve only used it for a month. And the seller is amazon. Weird. Phone was in a protective case and i was sitting in a chair low to the ground when i dropped this 2 month old phone while taking it out of my pocket. The touch screen and lcd broke after about a 2-3 foot drop onto the floor. A drop my old phone (moto g6) had survived hundreds if not thousands of times. The glass on the n20 didn\\'t even crack or shatter it was such a light fall, but now I have dead lcd lines and a broken digitizer that prevents the touch screen from accepting any inputs. What\\'s worse is that usually budget phone replacement parts are cheaper than on flagship models, but not this phone. My local repair store Quoted me $230 to replace the screen and didgitizer. When I bought the phone brand new for $250. I thought they might be upcharging me but i the lowest repair quote i could find was for $200. Then i thought if i can find the parts maybe I\\'ll do replace it myself, but this phones screen is too expensive. The cheapest i could find the screen and didgitizer was $130. where the oneplus n10 screens and n200 screens are $40-$50. This is poor internal build quality. It was not a hard drop at all and again it was in a solid protective case.I bought this phone because it looked like a good value for the money. It has a decent processor good amount of RAM and memory, and ran well, but I REGRET BUYING THIS PHONE. IT IS FRAGILE AND COSTS TOO MUCH MONEY TO REPAIR.I\\'ve been a budget phone user for years and I understand that part of the budget is materials that aren\\'t as fancy My last phone (a moto g6 which lasted almost 4 years and thousands of drops before breaking the charge port). But this phone is not just cheaper materials. Its a cheap design that is waiting to break as soon as it has it\\'s first run in with gravity.If i get a chance I\\'ll post a quick video this trash phone so noone can accuse me of veing a bot for the competition. The Nord N20 5G is speedy. Looks good. And has a very nice camera. You get a headphone jack! An SD Card slot!!. 128GB storage to boot!. And Oxygen OS runs great so far. I get the best signal I have ever gotten. Which is a huge PLUS!. Didi Mao, get yourself a Nord NOW! Looks like a great phone and it is advertised as Unlocked, which to me, meant I could take it to any carrier. WRONG! As of this writing, this phone will not work on Verizon. I was really liking this phone, but lately it has been freezing, which makes me have to restart it every time it happens. I just might send it back while I can. So no far is working good and works perfect in Canada. Hard to beat for the price, especially if you can find it on sale!  I love that it has a headphone jack.  Works great on the T-Mobile network. The media could not be loaded. This is a good phone. The OxygenOS is clean with almost no bloatware. But be cautious, I think this phone only works in T-Mobile\\'s network (including MVNO, like Mint Mobile, Tello and etc.). Easy to hold and operate. I have had the phone for about a month and like the Wifi, screen display. No complaints. Nice screen, battery and quick and responsive. All the bells and whistles on a budget phone Decent build. Basic camera function, donâ\\x80\\x99t expect great photos with this cheap phone. It starts to lag when running multiple streaming apps.This phone came unlocked with one Sim card slot. Memory can be expanded with a microSD card.The screen is pretty sharp nice viewing angles and the fingerprint scanner is pretty fast. This phone also comes with face unlock but it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t work for apps. Good alternative to Samsung phones. Me ubiera gustado un poco mÃ¡s grande, muy buen sonido en el carro en todo lo demÃ¡s estÃ¡ muy bien quede satisfecho gracias The battery is amazing and last so long, also the pictures come out great, love the camera, so far it\\'s been about a week, and I really love it amazing, I think so far the best phone I have ever had. It look nice, its stylish, feels good in the hand, nice weight to it. 10/10 would buy again and I would most defentilly recomend this to my friends and family. In my case I am facing some issues with Bluetooth system sound when I calling via what\\'s app . It is disconnecting every time while in a video call in what\\'s app. But for music it\\'s working fine. It\\'s an average phone that works well and does what I need. It came at a great price and is compatible with my provider. The keyboard layout is a little unusual, but one gets used to it. Update 10-14-2022Still trash, For some unknown reason messages from whatsapp are not showing up at the lock screen. It does not wake the screen either. Sometimes I don\\'t even see the messages looking at the screen. No pop ups. I checked all notifications settings including lockscreen settings to show all info and nothing man this phone is so trash. Better off buying the n10, I updated this review from 3 stars to 1. How the hell did oneplus f up this phone.Very disappointed with the downgrade from oneplus. Most apps I used on the Nord n10 don\\'t fit the screen anynore, I can\\'t see the time stamp on youtube shorts because it doesn\\'t fit to screen. When you get a whapsapp message you can\\'t reply from the notification bar because it doesn\\'t fit you cant even see what you are typing can click send. I don\\'t recommend this phone to anyone, you are better off getting the N200. Also the keyboard is lifted from the bottom of the screen and sometimes you can\\'t see where you are typing. Overall 0.5 out of 5. The screen sucks.Adding more: Bluetooth audio drops randomly and every app won\\'t play videos/music for about 1 minute. You can see the song time moving then you get the audio delayed. This doesn\\'t happen on galaxy s8 or s20 or pc. I had the N10 for longer and I never had any issues, this only made me never buy an oneplus product ever again. I ordered this phone and the GPS feature did not work at all.  I tried all sorts of ways to fix it which were recommended by the manufacturer as well as my network provider.  I even tried a factory reset.  Nothing worked.  I returned the damaged phone and ordered a new one.  Again, the GPS does not work.  I do not recommend this phone. Fast delivery and received my phone as described Excellent The phone is great, exactly what I\\'ve come to expect from OnePlus. A higher end budget phone with everything I need.I almost returned it on principle due to the arrival condition, the package was opened, the phone was wrapped in a paper towel, the factory screen protector was missing, and the power cord had been hastily shoved back in the box, the booklet and sim remover key were missing entirely. I was clearly shipped a returned/or refurbished device with nothing in the listing providing this information. I tested the device an found no damage or flaws however if this is what the seller/amazon considers ok then I will have to shop elsewhere Perfecto para mÃ\\xad uso diario, gran capacidad para fotos y buena cÃ¡mara OnePlus n20 5g is Very good budget phone, I bought this phone as a gift to my father, replacd his iphone 8+pro,he likes this phone.everything is easy and smooth Excellent 5G under budget. Decent camera and overall good functionality! Solid phone for the priceBut the screen is the main buying point for the price.Extremely color accurate and bright It didn\\'t work. I couldn\\'t make calls. I couldn\\'t receive calls. I couldn\\'t send texts. I couldn\\'t get data. I couldn\\'t get on my own WIFI. I got a replacement SIM card. It didn\\'t help. For two months I tried to get it to work. I spent hours on the phone with clueless tech support kids. It was the worst excuse for a phone I\\'ve ever had. King for budget phones As slick and nice as this phone feels i have to rate it 1 star because the main screen freezes every 2 hours or so and needs a restart, making it completely unviable as a useful device. Will be returning this product ASAP, and others say they have the same problem so be careful when buying this phone. You will require patience. i have been on chat for over an hour and i keep getting info to do stuff that is not even on the phone.  it is almost impossible to switch to vibrate without going thru multiple screens.  the vibrate button on the top swipe down disappeared Disliked the fact that the Nord N20 5G phone is so heavy influenced by Google. Its a shame that a single company can wield that much influence on society today. Thought that was one of the reasons the government split up Ma Bell? Just about every app on this phone is powered by Google. Sent them back as we do not want Google in or monitoring everything we do,  say and go. Phone did have good battery life and I do miss the 5G connectivity but I will survive with my old 4G phone. During setup it was crystal clear and vibrant,  as soon as I was done with setup, it appeared to go into eye saver/reading/night mode where everything had a sepia or yellowish tone and no settings hinted as to why. Even turning brightness all the way up and setting the color setting to cool, all of the blue light was omitted. There were no settings anywhere that would undo this. Looked up a fix online and this seems to be a problem with many of the 1+ phones. A reboot fixed it in my case. But then it soon reverted back. Not keeping a phone I have to reboot constantly just to keep my screen settings constant. It went back. Happy 5 Month review: I was hoping that this was a return to OnePlus\\'s roots; quality hardware at a low price with near-stock Android. Unfortunately, their OS has become very bloated over the years: \"suggestions\", \"recommendations\", and notifications from apps that cannot be uninstalled. In short, this phone is covered in un-skippable ads from head to toe. I\\'ll never buy from OnePlus ever again. Thank you, 1+ Nothing good to say except for the battery life.If you live in US stay away from this phone- it doesn\\'t have Volte, a required functionality of many companies. I\\'m forced to keep a foreign sim to have data.- Pictures are not that good. X2 and x5 zoom take pixelated pictures.- signal reception bad, my old Samsung have where this doesn\\'t. And many up and downs on data speed because signal.- screen touch sometimes don\\'t detect the touch properly- I wish I had checked everything properly on time to return itI thought was a good phone as had many positive reviews... We had a one plus 5 phone so trusted the brand and bought this. Nonetheless in less than 60 days, the phone started to give major issues. Network dropped unexpectedly and cellular signal would not work despite being in high cellular network areas. GPS on phone did not work too well either. Completely lost full money and never buying this brand again :( I am a Verizon customer, could not use this product. Publicidad engaÃ±osa No esta desbloqueado para todos los proveedores de servicio.!!!ð\\x9f¤·ð\\x9f\\x8f»â\\x80\\x8dâ\\x99\\x82ï¸\\x8f So different from other phones that learning curve is a major pain. I bought this phone and was super excited about it. This phone is not unlocked. Now I ba e a phone I\\'m using that\\'s taped together. I\\'m also having problems returning it. When I put the sim card in, the phone was able to display the phone number details but tmobile would not connect the service. The only way to use this is by connecting it to wifi. I got one from tmobile for the same price anyway. The phone is fine but this description is not honest. Cheap not worth the money while being advertised as UNLOCKEDThis phone is CARRIER LOCKED TO ATT.. it refuses to process the unlock  with the device unlock app.. returning...  1 star review for false advertising Don\\'t listen to the product title. The phone isn\\'t actually unlocked This phone is cheap it\\'s not worth the price.  Don\\'t waste your money. Buyers should be aware that this unlocked OnePlus Nord N20 5G (128 GB) works in 5G mode only with T.Mobile. With AT&T, it is LTE mode (2G/3G/4G LTE) and not compatible with Verizon in any G. Please check OnePlus website for further details about compatibility.  It has only one speaker. Though the phone comes in Android 11, it gets upgraded to Android 12 version automatically. WiFi Calling feature and all the 5G features are available only in T. Mobile. My primary uses are calls, messages, WhatsApp, checking emails, some social media posts, taking few pics once a while, etc. This phone suits perfectly well, for my needs. My old phone Moto G Play (32 GB) used to operate in 2G/3G/4G (LTE) environment. The new phone OnePlus Nord N20 5G is lightening fast in every task. Very good phone for this price. Bright screen, snappy response.The notifications are so low that I miss texts all day long. I am writing this review with the phone on Metro by T-Mobile\\'s 5G network, and it is an excellent phone. At the time of this review, I got this phone for $50 when I switched from another carrier. I have a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra but wanted something different to use and I really like it. It\\'s got a beautiful AMOLED display, plenty of storage, gets great reception, and the battery lasts forever. I didn\\'t realize how much I missed having a headphone jack until I got one back! The build quality surprised me as I have not had a phone made out of metal for a long time, which makes it tougher than a phone made of glass. It has an underscreen fingerprint sensor that is compatible with glass screen proctectors, further increasing durability. Also, the charging speed is pretty dang fast. As for the speed of the phone, it\\'s snappy for everyday things, but do not expect it to play games like an S22 Ultra. The camera is decent, it leaves some room for improvement but for the price you can\\'t really complain. I took a photo of a hibiscus flower to give you an idea of the camera quality. At this price point, I\\'d be hard pressed to find another deal like this, even at full price. I highly recommend this phone. What do you get when you combine iPhone level optics, reliability, and security with Samsung compatibilityâ\\x80\\x94and throw in a display that rivals them both? The OnePlus N20 5G. With an edge to edge display and a steel frame reminiscent of an iphone, the N20 has certainly made it\\'s parents proud. The touch registration is instantaneous, the display is vivid and responsive.  It\\'s a flagship phone for middling price. The only test that remains is the test of time. Won\\'t work on Verizon or Straight Talk. Wish I had known that before I bought it. I like everything about this phone except that it did not come with even the most minimal instructions. I had to ask my son how to answer it when it rang. I still haven\\'t gotten texting and messages correct. These are basic things that everyone seems to do with their phones. I am older and at this point we are going to be off the landline and functioning with the cell phone.The screen is very clear and easy to read although I think I want to see if I can make the fonts bigger. I know that after a while I will feel more comfortable with it. I am disabled and am happy that when I have to drive for errands now that I can call for help if needed. This phone is so different than my last cell phone, that only had phone capabilities but I gave up when I could no longer work 20+ years ago.I appreciate the opportunity to try this out. Thank you. OnePlus is known for making quality products that consumers can purchase for a fraction of the price of the competition. These phones are feature rich and it shows when using them. The Nord N20 is no slouch when it comes to handling tasks, the camera is great, the size of the phone is very nice and feels comfortable in the hand. The screen is full of color and the built in fingerprint reader is quick and accurate. So why 3 stars? The phone will not be getting the new android 13 update, nor the previous Android 12. While this is supposed to be a budget phone, it is not getting the software treatment that it deserves. As a result, I am docking this heavily to push consumers to one of their other devices for roughly the same amount of money. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nÂ\\xa0This phone is probably the best budget Android smart phone with the minimum sacrifice of some features. I absolutely love the big bright AMOLED screen, long battery power, and huge 128GB built in storage, plus expandable microSD slot. I inserted a 256GB microSD card along with my Mint mobile SIM, and now this phone has more storage than my MacBook Air. Mint mobile works okay in my area, so I have no issue using this phone for calling and mobile data connection. I see VoLTE turned on along with 5G connection here and there outside my home, and the connection speed is nothing less than I expected from Mint mobile.This phone has 64 megapixel triple camera, so my expectation was a little high, but then, I was quickly disappointed that it did not have a wide-angle lens. The overall photo quality is good, and I love the â\\x80\\x98Dual-View Videoâ\\x80\\x99 that both front and rear camera record videos at the same time in the same frame. Using that feature is super fun because recording my facial expression when recording something else at the same time is awesome. However, I am still debating whether I like the AI effects on the faces. I could control the amount of effects or turn the effects off if I wanted, but it is kind of amazing what phone cameras can do in real time these days. I am not a selfie person, but this phone does take very nice photos for sure. For the video shooting, this feature is the major con in my opinion; it only can shoot 1080P at 30 frame per seconds. I expected 4k video shooting capability considering the storage amount, but sadly, it only does 1080P 30fps. Well, I cannot expect everything from a budget smartphone.However, somehow, this phone has under display fingerprint scanner. I have never tried under display fingerprint sensor, but it worked way faster than I expected, and now it is my favorite feature from this phone. The phone wakes up when lifted from idle position and shows the finger printing area on the bottom of the screen, and it takes no time to scan my fingerprint once I put my thumb on it. However, I would like the phone to wake up when I knock on it as well, instead of lifting.There are some other small things, such as no stereo speaker, no dual sim (e-sim) option, and no wireless charging that I consider as compromising for the budget, but this phone still has NFC and Google Pay capability along with 5G connection. Also, there still is 3.5mm headphone jack (no headphone or earbuds included).So, overall, I am happy with this phone. This phone is budget friendly, yet snappy and capable of everything I do with a smartphone in my daily life, and I especially enjoy its beautiful AMOLED screen and long lasting battery. this phone is awesome on t-mobile. for the price its probably the best unlocked phone you can get, with a couple exceptions. first off i compared this against a Samsung galaxy a52. they\\'re similar in price and around the same specs. the pictures taken with this in daylight are great, maybe even better than the Samsung as far as color accuracy. in low light however the Samsung is definitely the better due to a lot of lost details in the photos from the Nord.the screen is an amoled, but compared to the Samsung\\'s its a bit less bright and the colors aren\\'t as vibrant.the phone itself is quick and light. the fingerprint and face unlock are much faster than the Samsung, the call quality is also slightly better, although the Samsung has dual speakers and gets louder, especially on speaker.this is an unlocked phone and will work on at&t or T-Mobile as well as the various prepaid versions, metro and cricket wireless. however, if you\\'re using it on at&t service it will only operate on the lte network. the reason for this is that the bands needed for at&t 5g are missing from this phone. now, i do get decent speeds on lte, around 30mbps, and 5g service in my area is spotty and averages the same on my Samsung due to that. so, if you\\'re not concerned with 5g on at&t carriers and want a good unlocked phone that you can use with either provider this is a good choice. if you need 5g speeds and use at&t then i would check out the Samsung a52. The OnePlus Nord N20 5G is the successor to the N10 5G, sitting just above the Nord N200 in the company\\'s lineup as another mid-ranger from the company. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an attractive-looking phone, and it feels great in the hand. An AMOLED display, an actual good 64MP main camera, excellent performance, and nearly 2-day battery life round out what\\'s seriously the best cheap phone(opens in new tab) I\\'ve used in years. This phone is very thin, yet doesn\\'t shy away from a big battery. I easily got a day and a half out of every single charge. Storage is also expandable on the Nord N20 via micro SD card â\\x80\\x93 a luxury that few phones have afforded us in recent years.OnePlus opted for a quality AMOLED panel that looks simply fantastic all the time. It\\'s got those deep infinite blacks that only AMOLEDs can make, and the colors pop without looking unrealistic. I\\'d love to see a brighter panel in next year\\'s phone, but it\\'s not bad by any means. If anything, it\\'s just hard to photograph, and you\\'ll notice my outdoor photos of the display have a decidedly dim-grey look to the display because of it. Photos look very different in the viewfinder than they do after being processed by the phone, making it hard to know if a snap will get much better or much worse once you press the shutter, and we could have done without the gimmicky macro camera.However, the phone will bug you multiple times during and after setup to install more â\\x80\\x9cpremium app suggestionsâ\\x80\\x9d from the carrier. Most are benign like TikTok and Amazon Shopping, but others are ad-riddled news apps and â\\x80\\x98gachaâ\\x80\\x99 games, which are initially free but quickly start to offer in-app purchases. Make sure youâ\\x80\\x99re not just blindly clicking through the setup process, and youâ\\x80\\x99ll be fine.This phone also features something of a relic: the 3.5mm jack. Weâ\\x80\\x99re not sure why wired audio has become a budget-phone-only commodity, but weâ\\x80\\x99re glad to see it where we can. Bluetooth 5.1 is present on the phone for power-efficient wireless listening if youâ\\x80\\x99re into it, but however youâ\\x80\\x99re listening, the audio experience is fairly standard.Phones are expensive these days, but OnePlus is offering up a great device that\\'ll blow away your expectations without blowing up your wallet. Performance on this phone was reliably strong. Whether youâ\\x80\\x99re playing games or navigating the UI, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t notice that youâ\\x80\\x99re using a mid-range phone. I just picked this up for $39 with a new metro plan. This little powerhouse is blazing passed the performance of my outgoing LG G8 Thinq! I am not a power user, so this pretty much has everything I need. I got over 500 Mbps down during several speed tests driving around my town. I had the ZTE Axon 7 in the past. This phone has significantly more refined UI than ZTE. It is not overloaded with bloatware. I don\\'t care about the camera or the lack of wireless charging. I am slightly bothered by the lack of IP water resistance rating. I will just be careful with it but that price point I really don\\'t care. Screw what the naysayers are writing. If you\\'re not a power user and would like a nice android for a super affordable price then just get it. If anything you can use this until you save up for a flagship and then end up with a really decent backup in the event you lose that $1500 device. I\\'m really glad that I gave OnePlus a chance. Easy to use screen.  A bit difficult to set up but still, very nice.  Good size and it works well.  Great for anyone who does not want to sign on to a contract with a carrier.  Intuitive and user friendly buttons.  The face recognition works but I have disabled it for now.  It is not as easy to set up as an Apple or Samsung, but it is doable even for the less tech-savvy.  The screen is bright and clear and easy to read. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know which model is which but Iâ\\x80\\x99m pretty sure they all suck pretty bad all the same. This is the worst phone Iâ\\x80\\x99ve owned ever in my life. Iâ\\x80\\x99m pissed off that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had to own this phone for the last year. Iâ\\x80\\x99m never going to buy a Nord phone ever again, thereâ\\x80\\x99s so many things that I hate about this phone that thereâ\\x80\\x99s too much to write. if youâ\\x80\\x99re a casual phone user maybe using your phone maybe five minutes a day like an 80 year old person. This phone might be OK for you other than that I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t recommend it for anyone . I added a photo to show which model I own. Nord needs to stop making phones or make them at least decent before releasing these POS to the public. And Iâ\\x80\\x99m also pissed off at Metro pcs for selling me this phone in their store. With the current price of smart phones being what it is, I\\'m shocked that this phone is so reasonably priced.  This thing is an amazing deal!The display is super bright and vivid.  It\\'s hard to imagine it could be much better.The fingerprint reader is quick to recognize my finger.The pictures seem pretty great.  I\\'m not a photographer, by any means, but they\\'re definitely good enough for me.  I can\\'t speak to the selfie cam.... I\\'m not a selfie taker.The phone charges crazy fast and the battery lasts pretty long.  I think I read that it lasts around 2 days, but I\\'m on my phone a LOT, so no phone battery is going to last ME two days... lol.  But it does seem pretty good.I haven\\'t noticed a lot of lag.  Any lag I notice is probably more attributable to my Wifi, not the phone.This is a super solid phone for the price.You know how once your car has a few scratches or a dent or two you\\'re less worried about it in the parking lot and can breathe a little easier?  Well, I\\'m being really careful with this phone, but given the price of it, I can breathe a little easier and not be constantly worried about it like I would if it were four times the price.  That helps me relax a bit.  Plus I don\\'t feel like I\\'m settling, so it\\'s a win win. I needed a phone with SIM card slot when I travel because my iPhone isnâ\\x80\\x99t unlocked and itâ\\x80\\x99s been pretty expensive to use it. This phone pretty basic in my opinion, affordable to use as unlocked phone but honestly camera and user interface just very average. So as far as secondary phone, absolutely but itâ\\x80\\x99s not my primary by any means. We also decided to graduate it in a year and our oldest son can start using it as I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be heartbroken if he loses it or damages it. Overall good affordable phone that will do job. So I\\'m coming off the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G (man, these phone names are wordy now). My general impressions of that phone were that it was a solid phone with a lightweight OS and fast hardware but that the phone had some inherent flaws.And this phone isn\\'t far off from that experience, but with the added bonus that it\\'s less than half the price, which boggles the mind. Most of the specs are bumped back as you\\'d expect, but you wouldn\\'t notice unless you\\'re a phone power user. For example, I can\\'t begin to tell you how surprised I was that the quality of the OLED panel is fantastic for a $300 phone.The main two bits I\\'d complain about are that the camera cluster is a step down from its big brother: it\\'s missing an ultra-wide, which isn\\'t a surprise. Its speaker is also downgraded, removing one speaker from its sibling. Of course, the 10 Pro didn\\'t have that great sound reproduction, so that\\'s not a real point of contention either.What I\\'m basically saying is, you get a lot of phone for $300. I didn\\'t necessarily think the 10 Pro was worth its weight, but the Nord N20 absolutely comes in swinging. For 300$ one plus nord N20 5g ready smartphone.is definitely a good deal.Phone has 6gb ram and 128gb expandable.I love the blue smoke color.its very sharp looking.Large 4500mah battery. It does not drain fast.i do installed quite a bit of apps on my phone and it doesn\\'t eats up battery quick.Fast charging 33W.The fingerprint does respond pretty quick. Which amaze me because my other phone lG brand is not so good and it does lag with the fingerprint recognition.Face unlock also is quick recognition even in dim areas.The camera of this phone is great in a minimalto well lit  environment. I tested taking pictures in kind of dim room and it does not capture kind of good pictures even with flash on a bit of downside there.but it doesn\\'t take away of what this phone has to offer when it comes to price and functions.my overall view to the price and functions of this phone? I would definitely recommend this to anyone.its a great mid range phone that can fit to anybody\\'s budget. 6gb/128gb. Yes worth it definitely!. Conclusion: OnePlus Nord N20 is an affordable yet impressive smartphone that can meet any user\\'s requirement at a great price point.â\\x80¢A 6GB RAM and 128GB StorageI could download many games and applications , but it still didn\\'t lag. On top of it, I could store all my precious memories on it without worrying about the storage getting full.â\\x80¢4500mAh BatteryThe battery of the OnePlus Nord N20 gives up to 1.5 days of use time without recharging. Also, the fast charging enabled to recharge of the device at a turbo speed in less than an hour.â\\x80¢A Large ScreenThe screen of the OnePlus Nord N20 is 6.43\". I have a great time watching my favorite TV shows and movies on it. It had a bright screen that beautified every scene I watched.â\\x80¢5G EnabledThe OnePlus Nord N20 is 5G enabled to keep up with the latest technologies.â\\x80¢Very good camera qualityI could take very nice pictures that are comparable with the more expensive phones. Maybe only a few advanced imaging features are missing which I don\\'t see a problem for a phone at this price range. I am using the N20 for fee days and I can\\'t found a problems with the device camera or performance. Build quality in my opinion better than the any other OnePlus device in this segment you feel quality and sturdiness when you hold the device also and don\\'t put case on it. Screen is very good with nice angles of vision. Battery last hours without recharge. Sound is good but not exceptional. And the camera wao I have the OnePlus 10 pro and compare with the N20 in some cases this take pictures with more clarity indoors. Obvious when you zoom the picture the 10 pro offer better details but overall I prefer the N 20 . In my opinion this is the best option in this range of price more phone than the galaxy A53 what is laggy phone and overpriced just for have a Samsung badge. The OnePlus Nord N20 has been available through a few carriers like T-Mobile since earlier this year, but they finally made an unlocked version available this week.  You\\'re still limited to certain carriers like T-Mobile, Google Fi, Mint Mobile, and a few others.  AT&T is supported, but only at 4G speeds.  And Verizon is not supported at all.  So make sure you\\'re using a compatible carrier before you order this phone.  I have been using T-Mobile for years, so all I had to do was move my SIM card from my previous phone to this one.  My primary phone is an iPhone 13 Pro Max, but I have been using a Google Pixel 4a with 5G as my secondary phone for a while.  This phone is replacing my Pixel.  The processor is about 10-20% faster than the one in my Pixel, but the AMOLED screen is much better.  Plus the phone is lighter and also has nicer cameras as well.  So this is definitely an upgrade for me.  It does not support wireless charging, but it does support 33W fast charging, which enables you to charge the phone very quickly when the battery is running low.  The 2 main disadvantages to this phone are the single speaker which produces average sound at best, and the fact that only one OS upgrade will be offered (Android 12).  I am not sure why Nord won\\'t commit to supporting Android 13 on this phone.  But for $300, you can\\'t have everything.  Despite a few shortcomings, this is probably the best phone you\\'re going to find for $300 or less right now.  I recommend it highly.  Just be sure to get a good case to protect it. We got this phone as a first phone for our 10 year old daughter. We were looking for something inexpensive because we knew that there was a FAIRLY good chance it\\'d get broken.The phone was a pleasant surprise, It preforms amazingly well! Battery life is great, and recharge times are fast.The cameras are decent- not nearly the quality of our iPhones, but good enough for most uses. My daughter LOVES taking pictures and video with hers.The processor is fast enough to keep up with her online games, which is pretty important for her since it\\'s one of the main things that she does with the phone.While it is an \\'off brand\\' there are still a lot of accessories available for it like cases, etc. and at a reasonable price.Overall, a great value and highly recommended. Fast WiFi. Big beautiful screen. Great for these older eyes. Thin. Lightweight. Definitely a huge step up from the Moto I was using. I\\'m comfortable recommending this for use with the GoogleFi or T-Mobile services. My Moto G Power lasted less than 12 months before it totally died.It kept rebooting until it was totally dead!Followed support\\'s instructions to do a hard reset.Didn\\'t work!  Had to by a new phone! This has to be one of the best deals you can get for $300. The touchscreen works great, it\\'s very responsive, and feels good to use. The AMOLED screen looks really sharp and well lit (Not as good as the flagships but they are sufficiently good). The 6GB of ram and Snapdragon processor makes everything load fast and runs smooth. It can run graphically intense games and apps with ease. The battery charges so fast and I can get almost a days worth of moderate use in 20 minutes when I\\'m in a hurry. The cameras are amazing for a phone of this price range and it\\'s mind blowing how much of an improvement these are compared to the old phones we had just 10 years ago. They don\\'t work as well in low light settings and its also missing some nice AI features on iPhones and other flagship models but the picture quality is great overall. The build quality seems strong and it can survive some pretty big drops with a case and screen protector on it. It does everything you need and more for most people and it does it in a very affordable way. The only thing I can really complain about is the learning curve if you\\'re switching from an iPhone, but it was still pretty quick to learn. OnePlus Nord N20 5GI want give a shout out to this OnePlus Nord N20 phone. The performance is impressive at the level of $300 range. The fingerprint reader is especially helpful during the pandemic. Donâ\\x80\\x99t have any problems of playing most lightweight games and work great when playing videos.Charging time is short and the battery is durable. Not sure how long this will last, but so far itâ\\x80\\x99s all good as a new phone.The carriers are limited so please check if your carrier is supported. But otherwise if you are looking for an affordable phone you should definitely consider this! Very nice phone! Everything works great. Touch screen is nice and responsive! Highly recommend! It\\'s good to see name brands like OnePlus trying a little harder to make a budget phone with a competitive set of features and decent specs. Honestly, the lesser known brands are the ones that really tend to include a crazy amount of value on their $250-$400 devices, while more established brands (with names that people recognize), tend to include less for the price. This Nord N20 5G has virtually everything that a buyer could hope for at this price (assuming they are used to US pricing for smartphones and what tends to get included for $300). There are a few shortcomings on the OS/software side of the equation, and longevity is not this products strongpoint, especially when compared to a midrange device from Google or Samsung. They will give you 3-4 years of updates, or in the case of the upcoming Pixel 6a- 5 full years of updates.  Oneplus is only promising one update to get this phone on Android 12, but you will get 3 years of security patches in total, although, I am certain that they won\\'t be updated monthly, probably every 3-4 months. Even on their flagship phones, Oneplus only releases patches every 60 days or so. I think 2 OS upgrades would have been more fair, considering that this phone is already behind on its Android version.Now, let\\'s assume that you don\\'t care about or expect support in the way of security patches or OS updates. If that\\'s the case then everything else here is pretty good. The phone comes with 6.4\" Full HD+ AMOLED display, unfortunately there are no HDR capabilities here, it is an 8-bit panel only with support for sRGB and nothing else. So, it\\'s not really on par with an LTPO, 10-bit, 120Hz panel with support for HDR10+ and HLG. But, it is still AMOLED and has an excellent contrast ratio with deep blacks and vivid colors (when compared to an IPS LCD display on most phones that cost $300). One small plus is that this phone does support Widevine Level 1 encryption, so you can enjoy full HD content on Netflix and similar services. That feature is the first thing on the chopping block when you get down to this price point.The internal specs are also quite fair, you get a Snapdragon 695 (which consists of 2x Cortex A77/Gold p-cores and 6x Cortex A55/Silver e-cores) which is paired with 6GB of Ram( LPDDR4X running at 2133Mhz/16 bit dual channel). The 128GB of flash storage is UFS 2.2, so not as fast as the modern flagships, but not as slow as most phones at this price point which use eMMC. For people who are used to using flagship phones and the processing power of those devices, don\\'t disregard this because it has a Snapdragon 6-something instead of an 8-something. The CPU performance here is equal to a flagship phone from 2018-2019 (Snapdragon 845-855) although the GPU performance is a bit less and not equal to those older SoCs.I think that most people don\\'t come close to utilizing all of the computational power of their Android devices, even though they are paying extra to get it. If you don\\'t play intense mobile games, then there is really no good reason to get the best (or if you create content for a living and need the best camera performance). I really think the performance of the 695/Nord N20 5G is more than enough for the majority of mobile phone users.The camera situation is a little misleading, yes there are technically 3x lenses on the back of the phone, but only one of them is actually worth using. I really think this is a terrible habit that Oneplus has, putting useless 2 Megapixel sensors on the back of the phone so that it can market it as having a \"triple camera system\", when in reality, however much was spent on the macro and monochrome sensors would have been better used on just about ANYTHING ELSE. The primary camera is legit though, you get a 64 Megapixel main camera with autofocus (but without OIS). It\\'s capable of decent shots and the sensor itself is definitely good enough in my opinion, although it does suffer slightly from the lesser Spectra ISP. The image processing is just not as robust in midrange processors compared to flagship SoCs like the Snapdragon 888 or 8 Gen 1. I think that most people with be pleased with the results from the main camera, just don\\'t expect anything at all from the macro and monochrome sensors. One place that did get cut down was the ability to record video, you are limited to 1080p 30fps on the front AND the back. This seems a little crazy, you would at least expect 1080p 60fps, but I guess if someone really cares about videography on their smartphone, then they will be spending more than this on a device.The screen has an in-display fingerprint scanner, this is one benefit of using an OLED (as it wouldn\\'t be possible on an IPS panel). It feels as accurate as the one on my Oneplus 10 Pro, but it takes an extra beat to unlock. It\\'s also placed too close to the bottom (in my opinion), similar to the Oneplus 9/9 pro. It\\'s still a great thing to see on a $300 phone.Pros+6.4 inch, Full HD+ AMOLED screenIn-display fingerprint scannerWidevine Level 1 for Netflix and other servicesDecent Snapdragon 695 plus 6GB of RamUFS 2.2 storage speedHeadphone jack and Micro SD card slot33 watt fast charging wall adapter included in the boxCons-Released with a 1 year old version of Android and will only receive 1 OS version updateOnly one of the back cameras is actually worth usingVideo recording is limited to 1080p/30fpsNo Optical Image Stabilization on the main, 64MP cameraIt supports USB C power delivery, but I\\'ve had problems with some cables/wall adapters not charging the Nord N20 5G.

I will never use this phone and risk having to deal with this company again. OnePlus\\' Nord N20 5G is simply one of the best midrange phones on the market for Summer 2022.  Despite some flaws, it\\'s an extremely capable phone.  5 stars.I\\'ve had a couple OnePlus models over the years and share the frustration at the declining value proposition of the flagship models; compared to the early days, the high end stuff isn\\'t anything special at that price in comparison to other brands.  In fact, before I got this I was looking at a new old stock OnePlus 8 Pro as a replacement for a bricked phone; at half the original price, that seems to be the best option nowadays.  Their midrange models, though, still are pretty good - I have the Tmobile locked N200 - and this improves upon them significantly.  Incidentally, the N200 case won\\'t fit the N20 (the back camera lenses are a problem), but the screen protector works even with the front camera - and given the fragile plastic construction of the N20 I wouldn\\'t take this out of your house without putting both on.The two things I genuinely love about this compared to the N200 are the camera that at least brings it up to average quality (64 versus 48 MP, even if the other two sensors are largely useless and a dumb decision) and the fingerprint sensor being at the bottom of the screen with a much more natural unlock with your thumb versus on the power button of the N200.  This makes your decision to unlock far more logical, but I\\'d agree with their recommendation to do your fingerprints only *after* you put the screen protector on - made that mistake initially and then had to redo them all once I did!  I also like the headphone jack which the high end models now routinely eliminate.  And while 128 GB compares with the 10 Pro (which is bluntly not enough), the big advantage here is being able to use a micro SD card; this is something the flagships should have never taken out.But probably the biggest advantage to this phone is the SuperVOOC charger, which just cranks at 33 watts; this appears to require the actual charger included with the phone itself rather than any 65 or 100 watt one (which is frustrating) but it does charge from 50% to 100% within a half hour, making the already robust 4500 mAH battery feel far larger.  This is good because the battery does drain a bit between the OnePlus bloatware and not sleeping apps the way it should; OnePlus really wants you in their ecosystem and turning all the crap off (that dumb Device Detector feels like it\\'ll need a sideload to kill the request) is a problem; at least this version doesn\\'t include all the Tmobile junk.  Still, even with significant use you should get somewhere north of 12 hours, possibly more, on a single charge, and being able to crank it back up during the day with the 33 watt charger if you have it helps; I\\'m only a little concerned that it continues full bore and doesn\\'t trickle over 90%, which may cause problems with battery life.The screen is good; compared to a flagship you\\'ll notice the difference, but for the rest of us it\\'s perfectly fine watching 4k HDR, just not at high bit rate.  The processor upgrade to the 2.2 MHz Octo Core Snapdragon 695 and 6 GB of RAM pushes this from acceptable performance on the N200 to generally good on the N20; I don\\'t mobile game, but what I\\'ve been doing is running a whole bunch of extensions in Firefox and Chrome (via Kiwi Browser) that are desktop based like Alternate Player for Twitch.  On the N200 it was a noticeable performance hit doing so.  On the N20?  Doesn\\'t blink an eyelash doing so, and I\\'m really happy with its performance so far.The downsides?  The speaker is a mono one and not very good, and the fact we\\'re still waiting for Android 12 (guaranteed by OnePlus eventually) is a bit ridiculous, especially since Android 13 ain\\'t that far off.  I\\'m also not thrilled it\\'s only Bluetooth 5.1 and doesn\\'t support Wifi 6 and 6E; I get better speeds on 5G than I do on my home network.  Also, good luck rooting this for a few months; the process for the Tmobile locked version is still having problems, and I wouldn\\'t want to try anything else until things settle down quite a bit. The good news?  I\\'m using this on Mint and the configuration went through automatically without any effort on my part, and my 5G speeds on Tmobile\\'s network are impressive (even if the phone often wants to drop to 4G for power savings)The biggest drawback here is that as of this writing this won\\'t work on Verizon at all - and if you\\'re on AT&T, at present you\\'re currently limited to 4G, so this is really more of an Tmobile MVNO option (Mint and Google Fi) than a truly unlocked version for now.  As for competitors that some of the review sites throw out, are the Pixel 5A and Galaxy A53 better phones than the N20?  Arguably, but at \\'midrange\\' prices that are 50% more than this, those are now at price parity or even more expensive than new old stock flagship models from a couple years back; you\\'re probably better off looking at them instead.  For now, at this price point this is one of the best values on the market for a pretty darned good phone.  5 stars. For $299 this is a fantastic phone. You get a beautiful AMOLED screen, 6 gigs of RAM, and a snappy 695 Snapdragon processor. The camera is good with good lighting and it\\'s just one bottom firing speaker but those are reasonable compromises. It\\'s a joy to watch content on this phone and easy on the hand. The back is beautiful too. Budget phones sure have come a long way. Well worth getting for $299 or less. After looking around for cheap phones with great battery life I found this one. I\\'ve been very satisfied with it since I bought it in November. I\\'ve even dropped it a few times and no cracks or scratches. Also This phone is very speedy, almost no lag or wait times when loading pages or watching videos. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for an unlocked affordable phone. Great budget version of a flagship phobe for a great lower than flagship price. I was able to snag it for about $200! Expandable memory with micro SD card! Headphone jack and able to keep up with anything you need to do on it! Camera quality so far seems to be pretty great. Definitely no issues here. Bought it used \"good\" condition and it was like new, in the original box, with the original charger and everything! Would highly recommend this awesome budget friendly phone! I started with the iPhone 4 and just took my iPhone 7Plus out of service since Apple says it will not support iOS 16 or later.  Well, okay Apple...bye-bye.  So I moved to an Android platform; the OnePlus Nord N20 5G.  My FIRST Android mobile phone!  And yes, $230 feels much better than $700+ for a iPhone 14.  Ha, I have money left over to go purchase an Android watch.  I didn\\'t switch due to not liking my 7Plus; an Apple mobile phone is all I\\'ve used for 12 years.  It simply boiled down to limiting the out of pocket expense of replacing a mobile phone that was approaching end of life.I\\'ve been using the OnePlus for three days and I already like it.  Everything works smoothly; not one issue thus far.  I think with an attitude of \"give it a try,\" moving from Apple to Android shouldn\\'t be problematic for people.  Yes, ego and status can influence judgement.  The N20 operates a bit differently than my iPhone but the OnePlus is very capable and easily meets/exceeds my voice, texting, and photography needs....I\\'m not a \"power user\" by any means.  The Google Play store has all of the apps available that I had installed on my iPhone so I\\'m not having to deal finding alternatives.  Give me a couple of weeks to familiarize myself with the OnePlus and the operation will become second nature.  Just after three days, the iPhone seems \"clunky\" at this point.  Facetime and iMessages......so what!  The rest of my family will just have to deal with it.  Haha!If you happen to be a first time Android user and are looking for a great value the OnePlus Nord N20 should be on your short list.  Oh, I\\'m on T-Mobile.  New SIM card and 15 seconds later I was back in service. Shopping in $300.00 or less range for phones can be daunting but this phone really shines. It is definitely a big step up from my LG K20. Phone is sleek and OxygenOS is very nice to work with once you get used to it.Set up was easy and I was able to transfer most of my apps and data wirelessly between my old phone and the N20. I\\'m getting no dropped calls and texting is working well. I would have liked a better camera but this one works well for my purposes thus far.....I really haven\\'t used it much but it does function intuitively when taking pics. The phone updated to Android 12 on day one with no problems. Download speeds are insane and faster than my internet at home. With 6 gigs of ram and ram boost using the phone is very smooth. I haven\\'t loaded any games so I can\\'t speak to that right now. Battery life is excellent it charges very fast.In my opinion this phone is a very good value, it ticks all important boxes for me and has been trouble free to date. I don\\'t think you\\'d regret this purchase. Easy setup..long battery life..highly recommend...very fast 5g Love this smart-phone....does everything I want in a phone and does it flawlessly.  Extra long battery life as well.  Great value. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nÂ\\xa0Very Slick Excelente dispositivo, su funcionamiento y rendimiento son buenÃ\\xadsimos I can\\'t believe this phone only costs around $200.00.  This phone has features and performance of much more expensive phones.  I really don\\'t understand why anyone would need anything more.  We are T-mobile customers and last year T-moble replaced my wife\\'s old 3G flip phone with a one plus 200N phone, for free, and I was impressed.  This is a slightly updated phone from the 200N the main difference being 256GB memory and 6GB ram.  I highly recommend this phone especially for the price, it maybe the best $200.00 you ever spent. Just received my new OnePlus Nord N20 phone. Today bought this phone as an early black friday sale for two hundred twenty nine bucks (plus sales tax) and received it the same day, today, via amazon prime delivery. I was waiting for an expected (early) black friday price drop and therefore immediately ordered this beautiful phone. Upgrading from my older OnePlus Nord N10 which is still good but has been flaking out losing the 5G connection and had switch down to 4G LTE on the older N10. Anyways the new OnePlus Nord N20 looks fantastic and reminds me of the iPhone with the N20\\'s nice flat look and the nice flat side edges like on iPhone. The TouchID Fingerprint Reader built into the screen is a nice upgrade. And the screen quality looks very nice. Android 11 immediately updated and rebooted the phone. Everything else regarding android looks kinda the same as on my older N10 but is newly different on the N20 phone. Anyways if you know your phones and android, then you can say this phone is easy to set up as you want it.  The phone offered to copy (clone) everything from my old phone, but I\\'ll do that later after I put in a microsd card into this new phone. You can put a 512GB microsd card in this phone -- but I may end up putting only a 256GB microsd from my other (old) umidigi phone. This new phone also offered to set up my credit card in Google Pay -- and therefore that means the new phone\\'s NFC works. And taking a quick snapshot with this phone\\'s camera indicates the camera takes very nice sharp pictures.  Well, so far I\\'m very happy with this new OnePlus Nord N20 phone, but I still have to complete migrating (cloning) all my stuff from my old N10 after putting in the microsd card and then give this phone a few days of my playing with it. I\\'m expecting no problems -- because a phone is a phone. And this is a nice beautiful phone. Feels quality made and very sturdy. A warp charger power adapter and USB-C cable are included with this phone. There is an instruction pamplet and a sim card pin is also included. There is no case/cover included -- but this phone is too beautiful and shouldn\\'t be covered up. So I\\'m very impressed and very satisfied with this new OnePlus Nord N20 phone. Highly recommend this phone. Thanks Amazon!=======P.S. UPDATE: okay took me a couple/few days to to fully set up my new OnePlus Nord N20. used the Clone Phone app to transfer apps/data from my old OnePlus Nord N10 to my new OnePlus Nord N20. then had to rearrange all of my 350+ app icons, shortcuts, widgets onto eight separate homescreens, including the need to recreate dozens of shortcuts/widgets, then had to log in everything etc etc etc. anyways that all was a lot to sort through and took a couple/few days -- but you know it feels so good to get your phone set up the way you exactly want it to be.oh, one annoying concern was setting up the APN if you have TELLO as your carrier provider to get a cellular 5G data connection. if you have Tmobile, just insert your sim card and your phone should work right away. but for TELLO, i\\'ve tried a couple of APN settings. here\\'s Tello\\'s prescribed simple APN setting:name: TELLOapn: wholesaleand here\\'s a Tello \"fast\" APN setting which was stable for a while for me:Name: TELLO FASTAPN: fast.t-mobile.comMMSC: http://wholesale.mmsmvno.com/mms/wapencMCC: 310MNC: 240APN type: default,supl,ia,mms,xcapAPN protocol: IPv4APN roaming protocol: IPv4this is actually similar to the default APN for tmobile (T-Mobile LTE) except the different MMSC and APN Type lines. HOWEVER, changing the APN did not permanently stablize the cellular 5G data connection for me -- meaning still kept losing internet when switching from WIFI to NO WIFI.So, for now, i had to resort to switching down to using only 4G LTE to maintain a stable cellular data connection because i am on TELLO. therefore set Preferred Network Type to 4G/3G/2G (auto). so no stable 5G data connection on TELLO currently. this is the same problem on both my old N10 and on my new N20 also. anyways after looking for solutions (or explanations) when reading reddit posts, seems like this tello 5G problem has been happening since June 2022 and may affect other MVNOs also? oh well, may eventually want to go back to real Tmobile (maybe get a Tmobile Connect plan?) or get on Metro-by-Tmobile to get a real tmobile 5G data connection.otherwise, one other good important thing worth mentioning is the NFC on this N20 phone does indeed work for using Google Pay. no real trouble there. but since this is a new phone, had to reconfirm my visa cards as they were already in my Google Pay but now using on this new N20 phone. and, yes, it worked when i went shopping and paid for my purchase tapping my phone at the checkout register. yay! it works!but one annoying have-to-live-with-it change on the N20 (compared to the N10) is you cannot specifically minimize notifications to a single line  -- some notifications will automatically minimize to a single line if you select to silence (\"Set as silent\") the notification BUT others cannot be specifically miminized to a single line. me thinks this change is from the new influence of the OPPO ColorOS on OnePlus OxygenOS because the Android/OxygenOS 11 on the N20 is somewhat different (modernized???) when compared to what 11 is on N10.another noticeable change is the print dialog which takes up more of the screen with buttons, but if you want to print to a PDF file, press the triple dots in the right top corner of the print dialog to get the Save As PDF prompt.and yet one other annoying omission which is easy to fix is with the onscreen keyboard which may NOT have a pointer (arrow) for you to press at the bottom of the keyboard to disappear the keyboard. just install an addtional new keyboard, such as the microsoft swiftkey keyboard, from the google play store, and you should be able to continue to use the default Gboard keyboard with an added/restored pointer < below the botton row of the keyboard for you to press to disappear the keyboard.one last good thing to mention: the lift-to-wakeup ambient display does give you the TouchID to press to open the phone. that\\'s nice and handy when you pick up your phone. but you may want to make sure to turn off the Always-On Ambient Display to save on battery.anyways, so far after a few more days, got my new phone working the way i want it to work.=======P.S.S. NOV.30.2022 UPDATE: my OnePlus Nord N20 got an automatic UPGRADE UPDATE to Android12 OxygenOS12. the homescreens are a bit different including how shortcuts appear on screen and how you cannot put shortcuts in folders nor in the dock. well the new Android/OxygenOS 12 actually wiped out all my shortcuts and widgets -- and therefore have to recreate them all over AGAIN. so, i installed Nova Launcher to be able to have much more normal homescreens with the flexibility to put icons and shortcuts together including inside folders and on the dock. and that means i have to rebuild all my homescreens again. sigh. it\\'s nice to get Android 12 on my phone, but the new Oppo-ColorOS-influenced OxygenOS 12 launcher really sucks if you like to customize your homescreens. so, my suggestion is install the Nova Launcher from the Google Play Store.... ALSO, back to my situation with the TELLO 5G cellular data internet connection, looks like i could switch to MINT Mobile which i\\'m testing and looks like MINT has much more stable 5G. however, the new Android12 OxygenOS12 does give me hope to maintain a stable 5G while on TELLO because in the Developer Options, can go to 5G Network Mode and switch only to NSA Mode.  Apparently, according reports on Reddit, if it connects to SA mode, TELLO has problems connecting to 5G. so for now, as i would like to still stick with TELLO on this OnePlus Nord N20 5G phone, i\\'ll go with only the NSA Mode for 5G and hope nothing else breaks. I\\'ve had this phone for 6 months and I love it. Plus it\\'s only 1/3 what an iPhone costs. Love how it fits in my hand, slim not a brick.  Excellent battery life, and the 33w fast charger is no joke. The OLED screen is so crisp, camera takes decent pictures,  The fingerprint scanner and face recognition is excellent, so accurate and fast.  I\\'m still exploring, but so far I love it. Easy to use Read the reviews on how good a deal this was in terms of what you get for your money, and cannot disagree. I Like This Phone Bought this for my son. He says itâ\\x80\\x99s fast, works great. He seems to really like it Really snappy and decent camera. Finger print works ok. Package was really nice. My son bought this model because it was a good value.  Camera not the greatest but gets the job done. Screen is nice, specs are good, battery life good. Es rÃ¡pido buenas opciones de fotografÃ\\xada y cumple con todo lo prometido ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 I was going to leave a bad review. Trouble connecting? Call the Amazon help line not Tracfone. (very frustrating) ... Amazon was help and fast.. This is easy phone too, The # calling shows cover closed and you just open to answer (nice) hit the big button inside to switch to speaker if your deaf like me. You use the same big button to send a call after dialing. It\\'s all I need. Can\\'t beat the price and the one year prepaid comes out to less than 9$ a month. If you need an inexpensive phone or a backup... This will do the trick. 02 now I don\\'t have no complaints it\\'s been two days three very good I like it because you have music that you can download and keep it for yourself very good tones very good apps all around very good for the price is perfect After a rather lengthy and frustrating phone call to customer service, I was finally forced to take this phone in person to a local WalMart to get it activated.Once activated, it worked great - for about three days. Then it went dark, never to light again.I put it on the charger, took the battery out and put it back in, whacked the phone against my desk, etc.Sigh.

It\\'s not the button at the side, it\\'s the hang up button to power on. After buying a plan separately, everything worked. i like that it is small, but one of these units that I got failed 2 work.  So I need to replace it. To call & get calls and messages. Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t connect to a network. Working on it for two days. Iâ\\x80\\x99m very frustrated because Iâ\\x80\\x99m a long time customer of the network. However, itâ\\x80\\x99s not there fault it the phone is defective. I bought this for my elderly father who hates new electronics. Now he even hates them more because after setting this up he is unable to call his home! That is the reason I got him this! Both my parents are handicapped and he needs to check on my mother when heâ\\x80\\x99s out and it will not ring their land line at all! I bought this phone and bought a 30 day unlimited talk and text for $15. Tried to activate it with a monthly card, DID NOT work. DO NOT BUY. After spending over 1 hour with customer service, the gentleman who I talked to talked very fast and had a strong accent was difficult to understand I kept asking to repeat. Finally, I got the phone to operate. However, he would not divulge my number, informed me to call another number which I did not. What I did was have a person I know I called and got my number from him as he has number ID on his phone Purchase this phone try to activate and was impossible customer service it\\'s rather worse part. Could not activate should not be sold in GB when you cant activate them only USA or Costa Rica Canâ\\x80\\x99t activate Warning for a hearing impaired person. Even if you only have a slight hearing impairment the volume on this particular phone may not be adequate.The phone otherwise is fine. Works well, large enough for big hands, small enough to fit a pocket or purse. Just no volume adjustment.I\\'ve had two and both had the same problem. I went to a cell phone eventually which had a sensor that works with my hearing aides. Much more expensive, but no frustration asking everyone to, \"Please repeat\" again and again. Hope this helps someone. all prior phones I\\'ve had used the universal small USB  . The Nokia uses a proprietary charger which limits its use. I bought this from Tracfone Ebay store a few months back. It was listed as Android phone. But it is not. I wrote to Tracefone on Ebay twice but received no response. The phone was never replaced as requested. This day in age, no matter what is a person\\'s age, this Non-Android phone is practically useless. But I do admit, this would be a great phone for 911 calls. I had a LG Exalt that I had to replace b/c it was 3G.  This phone sounded like it would be decent.  My old LG smokes this phone in terms of speed and features.  This Nokia is slow by comparison.  Also, when the phone is closed, you can see a contact\\'s name if they text you but not when they call?  What\\'s up with that??  Had high hopes for this phone but I am disappointed big time. And yes, it has snake! The absolute worst and rudest customer service I have ever experienced. I can\\'t speak to quality of the phone, because they could actually never get mine to work. Hours of my life I can never get back. My I\\'ll friend needed a flip fone. Worked great but she lost it. She left it in her apt when she was taken to a nursing home. Bought it for my grandma since she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t like touch screens and is pretty good, easy to use good speaker I like it No touch screenCan\\'t voice textJust a flip phoneWhich is just what he wanted I needed a \\'phone\\' to use as hardware for a particular piece of software. I never intended on using this as a phone to make calls or texts or even WhatsApp. All it had to do was run an app with a database and make use of it\\'s camera, however basic it may be.Does it even compare to the Moto G series or the Samsung A series? No, in no way. I wouldn\\'t want this to be my main phone. But for the price I paid (around $50) it does what I needed, what I expected and it does it well enough. I\\'d buy this device again.It\\'s great as well if needed to hand a basic phone to a minor as a first phone. Does all that I need at a much lower cost The battery life is okay but the rest of the features aren\\'t great at all. The camera doesn\\'t take an instant picture and also, it\\'s always red eyes with no editing option to correct. Whenever I\\'m receiving an incoming call, I keep swiping to answer it and it seldom works and I loose the call. Not happy at all with it. Pretty good phone but battery life is short and it doesn\\'t have back or forward buttons, I have to swipe screen to get home and touch screen is slow. I was hoping that the phone would work a bit better than it does. It is lagging so bad, cant do much online searching, going on YouTube, forget about downloading a game.The phone is cheap and doesn\\'t work well at all Seems to e a good phone but it was gift for my son no complaints from him Believe it or not it\\'s the best phone I\\'ve owned so far I bought this for a friend and it works great, no issues, not slow!! For $50.00, I like, and it works well for me. It is not like my iPhone, but that is ok. I bought it for a work phone. Difficult to use for a senior. Second day, even with new number, began receiving foreign spam calls which were very upsetting.  Even folk who were â\\x80\\x9ctech savvyâ\\x80\\x9d had difficulty so we returned it.

The phone was needed as a spare, screen quality great, battery life great, I would say the only negative aspect of the phone is the camera, low quality. Good for calls, text, social account, email, games. This is by far one of the slowest phones in my 15 years of living. My money wasted on the worst ever phone couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even download and app I wanted to download. Every time I want to type on the phone it takes a long time for it to respond. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE I bought this phone just to use google maps on it took it out the box and start it up itâ\\x80\\x99s acting like when you playing a game online and itâ\\x80\\x99s logging delaying and freezing same day I pulled it out the box  i requested to return it. Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t recommend This phone absolutely will NOT activate. It keeps asking for a SIM card, and there is already one in the phone. I followed all the directions through Tracfone, and NOTHING!!! Don\\'t waste your money on this garbage! Piece of junk. Battery life is too short. Screen freezes and crashes. A total waste of money. Completely dissatisfied. Don\\'t buy this phone. I canâ\\x80\\x99t get past the first screen. Itâ\\x80\\x99s stuck. In the process of returning it. Won\\'t charge up to work non function First off, I didn\\'t buy it from Amazon; I got it directly from Tracfone using rewards points. I submitted a similar review on their site and since I see people here had the same problems I had it might be a good idea to explain how my experience with this phone improved *dramatically* by changing one setting. One reviewer mentions there is no back button. This is because the setting \"Gestures\" is enabled by default. When I turned that off, it was like I was using a different, much easier to use, MUCH faster phone. I would imagine some people adapt to a feature like \"Gestures\" and learn to love it. But it just didn\\'t feel like it was worth adapting to because even when I successfully performed a gesture, it was unbearably slow to process. Plus, it all just seemed counterintuitive.So now by turning \"Gestures\" off, my opinion of the phone has changed 180 degrees. I originally wanted to slam it against a brick wall, but now I think it is a nice phone and a decent value. But it isn\\'t perfect. I agree with another reviewer that the battery discharges too quickly. I also am not thrilled with the charging process. With my old phone I would power it down completely, plug it in, and by tapping the power button I could bring up a simple animation showing charging progress. Doesn\\'t work that way with this phone. Had to get an app for the animation, and it doesn\\'t work unless you charge the phone while it is turned on. Any other issue I can think of are just what you get when you buy a budget phone. The obvious example is the camera is very basic. Too complicated does not work I bought for my brother as a gift now one can figure it out even tech people that are pros waste of my ð\\x9f\\x92° money and my gift was sure not a usable gift  I even bought the prepaid card too...and the phone took that .Please help Got mine at Walmart. Working great. The people saying there\\'s no buttons. You go to settings. You can change it to the buttons. Slow to react to selections, display keeps going black, Eats battery fast, wobbles on flat surface so they force you to buy a phone case, FM radio keeps stopping, very annoying \"logic\". I have never been more unhappy with a phone that I am with this.  It\\'s so overwhelmed by the basic operations that it struggles to function.  The worst part of it is that there are no back button, you know those 3 buttons on the bottom of every droid screen in the free world?  Those are not here, so you can never exit an application or go back to a previous page.  It\\'s like some lazy Engineer just didnt want to write the code for the keys so they\\'re gone.  Dirt cheep it is but a complete waist of 50 bucks is still unacceptable. Phone was exactly as described and came in fast! Did not buy on Amazon, but at a local WalMart store.  This C100 is a dog and I am taking it back.  Since I spend a lot of time out of the country I buy inexpensive phones with pre-pay.  Never have I been sold such a bad phone.  My last cell from Tracfone was an LG Journey and it could swim circles around this one.  I had it for over two years and had no problems until it just died.  I think this Nokia might have been a refurb, since looking at it more closely I can see some faint scratches on the back of the unit.  Stay away from these. Like other comments said this phone is slow the TCL A3 is way superior to this phone one problem over time the TCl A3 the charging port starts to don\\'t work also the screen turns dark not all the time but sometimes this budget phones this carrier be selling are no good save your money buy an iphone or Samsung Galaxy phone or Motorola Nokia phones need so much improvement Phone came the way it\\'s advertised! Love it Nokia phones are distinctive even at the lowest priced models. I didn\\'t see a facial recognition or fingerprint security option-I don\\'t use either anyway. It\\'s a sturdy standby and really easy for an older person\\'s level of phone skills-I have several movies downloaded to it and the sound quality is pretty decent,  too. The screen colors are vibrant for such as small device. Also I like that I can remove the battery if I want. No body can help me to fixing I lost my money Buen telÃ©fono por un precio bajo Si srve.

I followed all the directions through Tracfone, and NOTHING!!! Don\\'t waste your money on this garbage! Piece of junk. Battery life is too short. Screen freezes and crashes. A total waste of money. Completely dissatisfied. Don\\'t buy this phone. I canâ\\x80\\x99t get past the first screen. Itâ\\x80\\x99s stuck. In the process of returning it. Won\\'t charge up to work non function First off, I didn\\'t buy it from Amazon; I got it directly from Tracfone using rewards points. I submitted a similar review on their site and since I see people here had the same problems I had it might be a good idea to explain how my experience with this phone improved *dramatically* by changing one setting. One reviewer mentions there is no back button. This is because the setting \"Gestures\" is enabled by default. When I turned that off, it was like I was using a different, much easier to use, MUCH faster phone. I would imagine some people adapt to a feature like \"Gestures\" and learn to love it. But it just didn\\'t feel like it was worth adapting to because even when I successfully performed a gesture, it was unbearably slow to process. Plus, it all just seemed counterintuitive.So now by turning \"Gestures\" off, my opinion of the phone has changed 180 degrees. I originally wanted to slam it against a brick wall, but now I think it is a nice phone and a decent value. But it isn\\'t perfect. I agree with another reviewer that the battery discharges too quickly. I also am not thrilled with the charging process. With my old phone I would power it down completely, plug it in, and by tapping the power button I could bring up a simple animation showing charging progress. Doesn\\'t work that way with this phone. Had to get an app for the animation, and it doesn\\'t work unless you charge the phone while it is turned on. Any other issue I can think of are just what you get when you buy a budget phone. The obvious example is the camera is very basic. Too complicated does not work I bought for my brother as a gift now one can figure it out even tech people that are pros waste of my ð\\x9f\\x92° money and my gift was sure not a usable gift  I even bought the prepaid card too...and the phone took that .Please help Got mine at Walmart. Working great. The people saying there\\'s no buttons. You go to settings. You can change it to the buttons. Slow to react to selections, display keeps going black, Eats battery fast, wobbles on flat surface so they force you to buy a phone case, FM radio keeps stopping, very annoying \"logic\". I have never been more unhappy with a phone that I am with this.  It\\'s so overwhelmed by the basic operations that it struggles to function.  The worst part of it is that there are no back button, you know those 3 buttons on the bottom of every droid screen in the free world?  Those are not here, so you can never exit an application or go back to a previous page.  It\\'s like some lazy Engineer just didnt want to write the code for the keys so they\\'re gone.  Dirt cheep it is but a complete waist of 50 bucks is still unacceptable. Phone was exactly as described and came in fast! Did not buy on Amazon, but at a local WalMart store.  This C100 is a dog and I am taking it back.  Since I spend a lot of time out of the country I buy inexpensive phones with pre-pay.  Never have I been sold such a bad phone.  My last cell from Tracfone was an LG Journey and it could swim circles around this one.  I had it for over two years and had no problems until it just died.  I think this Nokia might have been a refurb, since looking at it more closely I can see some faint scratches on the back of the unit.  Stay away from these. Like other comments said this phone is slow the TCL A3 is way superior to this phone one problem over time the TCl A3 the charging port starts to don\\'t work also the screen turns dark not all the time but sometimes this budget phones this carrier be selling are no good save your money buy an iphone or Samsung Galaxy phone or Motorola Nokia phones need so much improvement Phone came the way it\\'s advertised! Love it Nokia phones are distinctive even at the lowest priced models. I didn\\'t see a facial recognition or fingerprint security option-I don\\'t use either anyway. It\\'s a sturdy standby and really easy for an older person\\'s level of phone skills-I have several movies downloaded to it and the sound quality is pretty decent,  too. The screen colors are vibrant for such as small device. Also I like that I can remove the battery if I want. No body can help me to fixing I lost my money Buen telÃ©fono por un precio bajo Si srve. Solo el chip no una buena tableta, pero no se puede desbloquear o usar en Mexico como celular My first smart phone and it is a joy. Great battery life. I used for 3 days with one charge. I purchase this with the Tracfone carrier but after two months the phone can be unlocked from the Tracfone service and used elsewhere. Very nice camera. The phone is easy to use. The outside shell is sturdy and durable and fits great in one hand. Only problem is when having the phone to your ear, the mute icon can get easily pressed. Otherwise, great phone. This was used, very used, as it was quite full of stuff, tracfone couldn\\'t reboot it to get it working had to return it for refund If l could give this phone 0 stars, l would. I bought & quickly returned this product within two days. The phone did what it wanted to do instead of what l was instructing it to do. More often than not I would be on the phone with a friend and all of a sudden Nokia would start dialing the person I was currently talking to. Like HOW?  There were other technical  issues that arouse, but honestly l don\\'t feel like typing them all. Heed my word, don\\'t purchase this phone. My first smart phone and it is a joy. Great battery life.

After many decades of buying samsung, I finally jumped ship - so to speak - and picked this model instead. First of all my UNlocked phone was locked when I purchased a pay-as-you-goH2o [ATT] sim for my galaxy a50 as we rarely have phone OR data coverage when we are in Michigan, a Great Lakes state that we visit often. Right now our current provider Mint Mobile, never has reception in Michigan! After using the h2o sim in my a50, my phone didn\\'t work as before and it took several looong tedious hours working with Mint before we finally discovered that h2o - via ATT - LOCKED our phone! We have gotten in touch with h20 AND ATT and neither has been human-enuff to contact us abt our problem! JERKs! I went ahead and got a new and very reasonably priced and DURABLE  phone - it bounced out of my pocket today as we were running - and not even a crack or a scratch! AmAzing!! I also can vouch for the customer service of the phone\\'s company UMIDIGI. Granted, I would love to use an USA-made phone, but none offer all that\\'s in this phone! As I am a photographer and am outdoors often, I am amazed that this phone is equipped with an altimeter and barometer to give appropriate apps the ability to use that data. Also, this is the first phone in decades that I didn\\'t need to search for a needle to access my sim holder! My a50 also offered fingerprint sign-in, but it was such a hassle I disabled it within a few days. This on the other hand, is so easy and accurate, I have used it everyday and will NOT disable it!! Sure there are a few issues and the company\\'s customer service has been very quick in responding, plus  have been so patient with me and are willing to work with me on the few issues I do have. Getting a new phone is a hassle in itself, but one that is completely different to what I\\'m accustomed to makes it a bit more tedious, BUT I am really enjoying my Bison GT2! Even at medium resolution of 48mp I am getting a resolution of 16:9 of 9216x5184, and at the highest resolution of 64mp at 4:3 at 9280x6944 which is nothing LESS than amazing! To ANY photographer, this is awesome and incredible resolution! I love the imagery I am getting, plus the feel of this protected phone - LOVE the bumpers on the corners! As I continue to explore and discover my Bison GT2, I will update!UPDATE 6Mar2023 & NEW GT2: Had my GT2 swapped with a jes-arrived new one. Now with a bit of experience with the brand, I went out to test it right away. Gone are all the problems experienced with the first GT2. ALL images in every mode are beautYful and sharp. The phone functions as advertised and more. Other problems not tested as much on original phone has NOT appeared in this phone. Granted, I have only had this phone a few hours now but everything\\'s MUCH better. It\\'s an incredible phone with great capability. I plan to use as much time available/possible to test it thoroughly, and on this phone, even the OTG function worked right off the bat with NO problems, unlike the \"other\" phone that required a LOT of work! The only thing I need to adapt to, is the saying SHOOT or SMILE to take a picture; unlike ALL of my previous Samsung phones this android doesn\\'t do that, and voice-activated cam apps aren\\'t as good as the samsung voice-activated cam app. I\\'d like to thank the awesome customer-support which has been incredible over the time they attended to many problems with the first phone!14mar2023: The FM radio works perfectly with NO wifi or antenna (headphones plugged in) required!!! Thermometer works great on skin readings and objects! Just discovered taking a pix, the up/down volume works to snap a pix. Because there are so many \"knobs\" on the phone\\'s sides, need to be very careful how you use/hold the phone. If you have a phone holder, it may work very nicely to avoid pressing on the side buttons. I\\'ve been using this phone for a week now and this thing is pretty impressive.Umidigi has put together quite the package here, even if it\\'s not targeted as an \\'every persons\\' phone.Although I\\'m not quite sure why not. Well, I guess it\\'s because it\\'s bigger and heavier than what most people equate with luxury.Which is kinda silly since they take their beautiful work of art fragile slim phones and jam them into a bulky case to protect them.Guess what, Umidigi has already done that for you and included a battery big enough to actually get you through a full day without even breathing hard.Seriously, it\\'s pretty hard to kill this battery during a normal day+ worth of useage.So much is packed into this phone, I don\\'t really have time to comment on everything in this review, the only thing kinda missing would be 5G support - but guess what, there is a version that has 5G support fo just a few dollars more if that is a feature yo cannot live without.There are not one, but two fully configurable buttons to play with, an underwater camera (which I haven\\'t been able to test yet, looking forward to it), and some really helpful sub funtions contained in the \\'toolbox\\' app.Things like a noise test, bubble level, magnifier, picture hanger, protractor, and the ever handy thermometer that I\\'ve come to enjoy having on Umidigi phones.As you can see from the pictures, this phone is built like a tank, and they aren\\'t bashful about it at all. You can see that they took some care in designing it for rugged use with probabaly not the the cleanest of hands or environments. The buttons stick out a bit, are differntly sized for easy identification and have a satisfying \\'click\\' to them when actuated.I\\'ve had no problems with WiFi stability or cell connection while using an AT&T mvno - signal has been strong and as stable as other phones in my possession.Calls are clear and the speakers are powerful enough to cut through loud and clear. One interesting piece here is that what is typically the bottom speaker actually fires out of the back of the phone.This struck me as weird at first - it\\'s a different design that we\\'re used to - it actually works quite well in practice. Plus, one less fragile item on the edge of the phone to break when you inevitably drop it.Which I have. I was going to do it on purpose to test the claims, but I\\'m a klutz and didn\\'t have to. I was eating and of course, knocked it off the table onto a tile floor. Glad to say that other than a small smudge on the protective trim it came through the ordeal just fine.Pretty sure if I was outside and bounced it off the concrete, it would suffer a few more scratches, but that\\'s probably it. Like I said earlier - this phone is built to shrug off abuse.I mentioned earlier that it is a bit heavy, which is due in part to the oversized battery (6,180 MAH) and the extra hardening. I find the extra heft an added bonus as it makes the phone, for me, easier to handle and grip. It\\'s not like we\\'re talking an extra pound or two in your hand, just a couple of ounces - which really is nothing.Yes, you can also feel the extra heft in your pocket - but hey, a t least you know somebody hasn\\'t pick-pocketed it off of you ;)To wrap up this mini-review, if you\\'re looking for a phone to use on the jobsite, are a klutz, looking for true all day battery life, or are just tired of paying a premium for ultra fragile all glass phones - this should definitely be on your list of phones to consider. It\\'s seldom that I play games on a mobile device. Back in the day, perhaps... But not much in the past few years. This being a gaming phone, however, I thought would be perfect for me. Initially, I was really looking for a phone with a long lasting battery, and during my search, I realized that phone cameras have really come a long way since my previous phone was out of the box. So, after finding the Bison GT2 , I was impressed with the specs. And, as I know no one with this phone, I figured \"why not?\". I did the iPhone 7 for the past two years and Samsung Galaxy for years before that. It\\'s time to get away from the main competitors. Both Samsung and Apple can suck it! Not only that, but after unboxing this phone...I fell in love with it right away! Of course, I had missed having an Android, but more than that, I needed something a bit more rugged that could withstand everyday mishaps and gravity, and as it stands, gravity and I are not the greatest of friends. So far, I am very pleased with the phone itself.As for the OS, I\\'ve always been more of an Android person since having had my first smartphone. I hated the iOS on the iPhone 7. That having been a free phone, I won\\'t complain... Except that I really did not like it.The battery on this phone has lived up to my expectations and I am very very pleased with just how long it does last. And the photos I\\'ve taken so far look absolutely phenomenal. I have noticed, though, that it\\'s only taking 48mp photos, which are still far superior than any phone cameras I\\'ve had...But still, I do wonder. It being a 64mp camera, how do I take 64mp photos? Is it something in the settings?Either way, I am very pleased with this phone and everything that goes with it. No sleekness, it won\\'t slip out of my hands, I don\\'t fear crushing it just trying to get it out of my back pocket, and I am confident in that it may even help make amends between gravity and I. I feel as though this phone was made specifically for me. I would definitely do business with Umidigi again, if needed!Thank you! my carrier did not support this device all major cell carriers DO NOT support this device find out if your cell carrier supports this device I did not now I am stuck with an unusable device and still have to use my old device good cost but no wear is the caution of being incompatible with most cell carriers I could not even change to a new carrier no one supports this device Bison 2 Pro, it may have more Rom, than it\\'s twin.Sometimes, it\\'s  glitchy and screen hard respond to touch.  Its a good phone, but not for me.  It\\'s better than Motorola.  No bloat ware, like the majority of cells. The phone stays cool, unlike Motorola.  Works with Mint Mobile.  It has boosting for apps.  Better than Samsung, and most major cell phone. Updated Review - After UMIDIGI Customer Care Representative contacted me by the name of Vicky, they assisted me in resolving my issue and granted me a partial refund. Because of their Excellent Customer Care Service I will definitely give them a 5 out of 5. Thank you to UMIDIGI and Vicky. I appreciate this greatly.This phone does not work with Trinidad and Tobago TSTT Sim Card!! 3 Days in with Mild/Moderate usage.Pro\\'s- Large Android Based Smart Phone- Feels Rugged and Buttons seem to work Flawlessly- Battery Life - Came with 97% when I opened the box on Friday. Phone set up, Charging my Apple Phone while setting up, Logging into accounts, updating phone and apps + Playing with settings and options phone still has 24% battery on Monday Morning. Approx. 7 hours of Facebook scrolling and video watching is included in the usage.Con\\'s- Clock in the upper left corner is cut off- Screen is a little too sensitive, will respond to a hovering finger- Unlocking system seems to be a weird Although the phone feels kind of big and unwieldy in your hand, it also feels durable and tough. It does not feel like a modern $900+ smartphone, but it also feels way less fragile; it feels heavy and plasticky. I wish the camera bump didn\\'t stick out so much and i wish the phone as a whole was smaller, but otherwise i have no complaints about the shape of the phone. The \"rubber\" corner bumpers are not actual rubber, they are just a softer plastic.The screen brightness is good, not great. the speakers are very loud and actually sound pretty great. You can use the FM radio without plugin in wired headphones. I get great 4G connection with AT&T, and i have no issues with any other connections (GPS, NFC, Bluetooth, Ect). The finger print sensor seems to work better than many other budget phone\\'s fingerprint sensors. You have to turn on the 90hrz refresh rate manually in settings, but the phone looks super smooth if you do. The battery life is decent if you have the 90hrz turned on, and its much better if you do not. Pretty much stock android with only 2 bloatware apps (\"tools\" and zelle). The extra two physical buttons are useful and well implemented; they are flush with the phone\\'s frame, making them unlikely to be accidentally pressed. The cameras are fine, they are high megapixel shooters, but the software seems poorly implemented, so the overall quality is somewhat lacking. The GPU/CPU/RAM are good enough that the phone never stutters and feels quite smooth during regular use.Overall, the phone is smaller than a normal phone with a high end protective case. it has some nice extra features, and everything is pretty well implemented. I\\'ve had no quality control issues with my device, and the seller seems responsive. Its not a flagship phone, but its pretty solid. I use UMIDIGI Bison a year and a half . Excellent durability ! Hope this one be the same . Only hesitate about navigation - previous model in NYC work only when speed is lower 10 miles and gives a lot or wrong direction loosing GPS on all bridges and in narrow streets of city. This is much better . Fast camera focus . stable GPS connection .  Only fingerprint sensor located on On/Off key is not good for me . The phone itself is nice!.. itâ\\x80\\x99s durable and functions how you need it. Yet unfortunately I was under the impression that itâ\\x80\\x99d work with straight talk. But straight talk doesnâ\\x80\\x99t recognize this model.. I have to return this product solely on that.

The extra two physical buttons are useful and well implemented; they are flush with the phone\\'s frame, making them unlikely to be accidentally pressed. The cameras are fine, they are high megapixel shooters, but the software seems poorly implemented, so the overall quality is somewhat lacking. The GPU/CPU/RAM are good enough that the phone never stutters and feels quite smooth during regular use.Overall, the phone is smaller than a normal phone with a high end protective case. it has some nice extra features, and everything is pretty well implemented. I\\'ve had no quality control issues with my device, and the seller seems responsive. Its not a flagship phone, but its pretty solid. I use UMIDIGI Bison a year and a half . Excellent durability ! Hope this one be the same . Only hesitate about navigation - previous model in NYC work only when speed is lower 10 miles and gives a lot or wrong direction loosing GPS on all bridges and in narrow streets of city. This is much better . Fast camera focus . stable GPS connection .  Only fingerprint sensor located on On/Off key is not good for me . The phone itself is nice!.. itâ\\x80\\x99s durable and functions how you need it. Yet unfortunately I was under the impression that itâ\\x80\\x99d work with straight talk. But straight talk doesnâ\\x80\\x99t recognize this model.. I have to return this product solely on that. SEE REVISION BELOWâ\\x80¦So far - so good on the Bison 2Pro phone. I bought it to replace an iPhone 8 for a trip to Europe later this year. First hurdle, does it work with Verizon? Yes it does, however I havenâ\\x80\\x99t officially set it up with them, just plugged in the SIM and made a call and texted. Second hurdle, does it work with my Bluetooth hearing aids? Yes it does, beams sound directly into my headâ\\x80¦.. Next hurdle, can I adapt my brain away from the world of iPhone? Weâ\\x80\\x99ll see over the next few months. Good news, I have used Dragon Touch tablets for years and am used to Android there.I ran the battery down to 20% like the instructions say to, to break the battery in properly. I plugged the phone into a C type USB charging cable that was handy, all good. I recalled that the instructions say to use the charger provided, so I swapped to that one. AND NOTHING HAPPENED! Swapped cables with their charger, still no electrons. Swapped in a high capacity charger (maybe they want more current) and finally we are charging. Swapped in the provided cable, and still good.So the provided charger is officially DOAâ\\x80¦. I knocked the phone down a star for the inconvenience. If the seller replaces the charger, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll revisit the review and upgrade it (assuming no other faults are foundâ\\x80¦.).REVISION:After 2 weeks, the Bison screen has gone to black and white, and has started blinking on and off. The on and off behavior has no relation to touching the screen or buttons. Unacceptable. I contacted the seller about the charger being DOA, but they havenâ\\x80\\x99t replaced it. Asked questions indicating user error! Unacceptable behavior! Iâ\\x80\\x99m returning the phone for a replacement (basically, I like the phone) and weâ\\x80\\x99ll see how the next one goes. I live 20 miles from Santa Fe, NM, and depend on my phone in case of emergency. Canâ\\x80\\x99t have it crapping outâ\\x80¦â\\x80¦. Talk text would randomly stop working even when I had a strong signal or connected to Wi-Fi. So I would have to reset the phone to fix it.  It also reset a couple times on me for seemingly no reason and deleted my wallpaper.  Would not allow me to receive pictures through text but that may have just been a carrier problem I didn\\'t understand.  Other than that the size and the weight is not bad it\\'s like having a rugged case on a normal phone. I absolutely loved the look and feel of it. It certainly seemed to be a very strong phone. I just don\\'t believe it\\'s systems are reliable The Umidigi Bison GT2 is a great phone at a budget price.  The processor was able to handle my everyday needs and usage, the battery easily lasted over 2 days, and IP68 water resistance.The processor is a mid-range processor from MediaTek.  Even so, the Bison GT2 was able to handle normal usage and games.  I was able to have multiple apps open and play games with no noticeable lag. Three cameras in the back is a plus at this price. Photos turned out sharp and vibrant.  With the IP68 certification, I even took some photos underwater (backyard pool).  :-)The battery lasted forever...actually, almost 3 days of regular use.  Only negative was this made the phone a little on the thick side. The Bison GT2 comes with a built-in case that protected the phone on all sides.  I purchased a screen protector to cover the glass and keep it from scratches. My niece accidently dropped the phone on the tile floors and no visible damage. The Bison GT2 has two customizable buttons that I set to open the camera app and FM radio.  Very convenient.I highly recommend this phone as your main phone.  Would also be great is a second phone for work or main phone for kids. We had this phone roughly 2 days before it started freezing. Then it started dropping calls, and currently it wonâ\\x80\\x99t allow my husband to call out periodically. Heâ\\x80\\x99s been told people have tried calling him but it never rings nor indicates missed calls. We were excited to try it since he is a farmer and this phone has great battery life reviews. I find that the over all function is less than desired. *Update 12/31/2022Been using this for a few weeks now. So far so good. The camera isn\\'t quite up to par (I\\'m going to check settings) but all-in-all it\\'s a very solid phone for the money.Upgraded to 5 stars for the price compared to the competition. *Update 12/15/2022Customer service has been good and although you can\\'t speak to someone by phone, they are attentive via email (given time differential with China). They currently have T-Mobile activated, and I am testing the phone which seems snappy so far.  Update 11/21/2022 - currently working with the company to see if we can rectify the compatibility issue. Have updated the star rating for their attentive response, and will report back. I do not normally write reviews but this phone was disappointing.  The specs looked great but after 2 days of working with tech support (I know a fair amount about this process), the result was that this phone is incompatible with the T-Mobile network contrary to the description.  The lack of support with an off-brand like this in the U.S. is a true downfall. Unfortunately, the better known brands necessitate their higher prices because of the availability of tech support. I purchased this phone for my 13 year old son for Christmas. Long battery life, great camera, and features. Also a bonus that it\\'s everything proof, as a teenage boy is rough on gear. I had no problems adding this phone to my T-Mobile account, however it is not a 5G capable phone. The 4GLTE works great and is plenty fast enough to play games and stream also. I recommend this phone highly for a first time phone. I find the back camera doesnt have good quality even though the megapixel is a high enough, the lighting is not picked up properly, however the phone is amazing The phones durability and battery life are very good but the in-call volume is too low. Right now nothing everything is perfect. My son got one, said it was unlocked for all carriers , he has taken it to 4 different carriers none of them could the phone to work on their network. the IMEI number was invalid. This is a very rugged phone, after updating the software IMEI , seem to work fine. Se mira muy bonito e inteligente.  Pero no lo pude usar pues aunque dice que es desbloqueado, no funciono con cricket, tuve que comprar otro chip pues el original se daÃ±o. Tal vez si funcione para otras compaÃ±Ã\\xadas telefÃ³nicas. Cumple muy bien lo prometido. Recomendado para trabajÃ¡is de campo y mecÃ¡nica industrial Nice phone with heavy feel. The 64 mb camera is good for zooming in and still having high quality photos. Used it for hunting, the extra tools come in handy. You can\\'t beat this phone at the $219.99 price on Amazon now.  Excellent screen quality and snappy with 8gb of ram with the G95 processor. Rugged and a good looking phone. The Umidigi Bison GT2 impressed me with its specs and price point. After using the phone I can confirm the following important points:- outstanding camera quality- durable rugged design will prevent damage- fast speed when doing tasks on device- outstanding battery lifeThis is my second umidigi device and they keep getting more premium at a lower price point. Im a fan! I used phone for everything including couple games, sometimes battery lasted 4 days! Once in a while numbers were selected instead of letters in top row when texting but it\\'s not happening now. To anyone looking to buy this phone please be aware! I bought this through Amazon as an alternative to the HTC. It isn\\'t bad, but it is very unstable. I\\'m using AT&T. This phone will not allow the mot recent update to the phone. It goes through all of the motions to update and then shows \"error 15\". At least three times a day it crashes and turns off and on. A few people I text only show up when the data is on (none of my previous HTC phones did this). Lastly, I have turned off ALL location tracking options I can find in the system settings and under all of the apps including the emergency stuff. This phone still shows the location tracking icon everytime the scree is unlocked and then goes away. I did write the company (in China) and they basically said turn the location off. I\\'m only passing the information on. Good luck. The phone is tough and the radio works without the headphones ð\\x9f\\x8e§  also it charges fast and lasts all day This review is for Umidigi Bison GT 2, a rugged 4G phone with 8GB+128 GB Internal Storage.This is a solid phone at the price point and a great choice is you need are looking for a durable rugged phone.PROS:- Great Design and its made for outdoors.- Excellent specs that delivers great features and good performance all over.- Comes with Android 12 and it is snappy.- Have lot usable internal storage out of box and it takes an SD card to expand if there be a need.- Supports 2G, 3G and 4G on Global bands. I tested on T-Mobile US network, no issues.- Speakers are loud and clear.- Camera quality is good and it can shoot videos in 4k.- Includes FM radio and other creative features.- Comes with screen protector pre-installed.- Battery is huge and will easily last couple of days on a single charge.CONS:- Phone has some weight to it. But it doesn\\'t bother me.- This is 4G device (there is 5G version of it, if you want it)- No wireless charging or fast charging, it takes a while to fully charge its big battery.I personally liked this phone and will recommend it.Edit-1: A week laterI discovered the main camera on the phone is defective, hoping its only the device I received. I am working with support and will update my rating and review based on final outcome.Edit-2: Seller was responsive and offered to replace phone under warranty. But I was asked to ship the phone back first, which meant I will be out of phone for few weeks. Contacted Amazon for replacement, they send me the replacement without having to return first which worked better for me. But replacement device also have same issue with its camera.CAMERA ISSUE: Main rear camera does not focus and produce blurry picture. The isdue is temporarily resolved if you lay phone flat face down and tap main camera lens several times.Both device I received have had this issue, so I am thinking this could be a defect in design and/or firmware. Otherwise phone function fine. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nÂ\\xa0I got this phone for my dad which loves to work on a lot of DIY projects. As a matter of fact this phone has a lot of tools such as bubble level, plumb bob, protractor, compass, barometer, etc.It works well on Mint mobile (which uses the T-Mobile network) using LTE frequencies. I know that someone complained that it doesn\\'t connect to the T-Mobile network but the one I got does and so far I haven\\'t noticed any issue (screenshot and video of speedtest on T-Mobile attached).Phone is also very fast thanks to the great processor and large quantity of RAM. Display is top notch and images are brilliant and sharp, even better that my other more expensive phone.My only complaint would be that the speakers are not the greatest and that it does not support the 5G network. Also, phone is somewhat bulky and heavy, but that should be expected from a rugged phone. Overall the phone works well and is fast like a flagship so I would highly recommend it. I am really liking this phone! Tough, a bit heavy and big. Battery is immense! Lasted nearly 2 days on a charge. Has 8gb ram/128gb storage with expandable memory which is sort of rare these days. Umidigi also brought back the notification LED which I missed. All in all a great cost effective rugged phone with a bunch of features. Reason i buy this phone because of the memory 256gb, and bonus the spec. this unit overall for me is very good, o hope this coming month of use o don\\'t have any problem of this unit. KudoS UMIDIGI! I have had this phone for about three days.  As implied by the title if this review, it\\'s a pretty solid piece of equipment.  Coming in at just over half a pound, you might think it chunky but is easily handled and comfortably fits in my hand.  The phone is responsive and I experience no lag with everyday usage activities.  A lot of the chunk comes from the huge battery inside and I have to say that with fairly heavy usage, I have been impressed with the stamina of the phones power source, easily handling a day of fairly heavy usage on a single power charge with about 20% to spare at days end.Although I haven\\'t put the camera to a full test, it is responsive and produces pics with good clarity and color.  I haven\\'t tried the underwater camera and quite frankly, despite the waterproof claim and the inclusion of an \"underwater camera function\", I don\\'t think I will be able to bring myself to put the bison under water on purpose.  One thing I don\\'t like is that the cameras extend out of the back of the phone just enough so that when you set your phone down on its back, it doesn\\'t sit flat but sits up on the corner where the cameras are mounted.  I like to use leveling apps and I can see this being an issue.  The g1 I am also reviewing, comes with a transparent case  which fixes this issue but the rugged gt2 doesn\\'t come with a case.  Not sure if there is cases available.I haven\\'t put an external memory card in yet but I suspect there will be no issues.  I had zero issues setting up the device with my sim card and it connected readily using 4G to my Bell service.  It has voice over data functionality which is useful when you can\\'t get a service provider signal but are able to obtain a stable wifi connection.My phone (the gray option) came with stock Android 12 which I have found to be very user friendly.  The only thing I haven\\'t been able to figure out so far is how to remove duplicate icons on the screen.Performance wise, the bison gt2 has done everything I have needed it to as fast as I want save for one slight shortcoming.  I use Deplike guitar processor app.  The latency checker in the app clocks the gt2 at between 48 ms latency with all other apps closed and 53 ms with a half dozen other apps open.  The app suggests that between 24 and 40 is good.  There is a noticeable delay between the time I pluck the string and when the sound comes out of the amp but way better than my previous higher end umidigi phones.  My work iphone (10 max) has no noticeable delay although I can\\'t check actual latency because the iphone app version dies not have a latency checker.  The clock speed of the dual core A76 processor in the gt2 is listed  2.05 GHz.  Perhaps the gt2 5g version which uses an A78 processor with 2.4 GHz speed would solve the latency issue (hoping to try one of those if I get a chance).The fingerprint sensor and face recognition work fast and flawlessly which is very handy and NFC is a must for tap and go payment and included on the device.  The two red, side mounted programmable speed buttons are definitely handy.  Wireless charging would be nice but isn\\'t available with this or any of the umidigi phones I\\'ve tried.  I have had the s3 pro, the f2, the g1 and now the bison gt2.With regards to the phone function itself, holding the phone up to the ear is fine for conversation.  With hands free using the speaker option, you have to be in a quiet environment to be able to hear.  I was iin a quiet environment and the person I was talking too had a hard time hearing me.  When I plugged in my apple headphones/earbuds into the 3.5mm port, the other person could not hear me at all.  I don\\'t know if this was because of a setting I needed to change, faulty hardware or a shortcoming of the phone design.  I did call my own number and changed my greeting using the same earbuds and while the resulting message did sound a bit muffled, it was loud enough so not sure what happened on the actual phone call. For media consumption, I find the single, back mounted speaker is a bit thin but loud enough.  I usually use a BT speaker so no issues here.This is a phone I plan on keeping.  Does most of what I need well at an awesome price point.  Eco-umidigi store have been very good and one day I hope to try the gt2 5g pro phone if it becomes available on the store.

The Umidigi Bison GT2 is a pretty decent phone for the price. It obviously does not perform like the latest and greatest flagships, but it also isn\\'t priced like one and it packs some unique features such as a large battery, ruggedized build, mostly stock Android UI, thermometer, Dual SIM, and FM radio. NFC and a high refresh rate screen are also nice to see at this price point. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack which is getting harder to find these days.Accessories included in the box are a USB-C cable and wall charger. The phone is very bulky and heavy, but the materials are good quality, and the fit and finish are quite good. The phone feels solid and appears to be rugged with additional padding on the corners to protect against drops.The screen is large, bright, and is of good quality. Touch response is ok for normal use, but probably not sensitive enough for competitive gaming although that isn\\'t really the target market for this phone. The speaker is quite loud. Haptic feedback could be stronger. Photos from the main camera are a bit soft, but it works well in well-lit environments. The two configurable hardware shortcut buttons are a nice touch.Performance is decent for the price. The processor is reasonable and the phone comes with a generous amount of RAM and storage. Battery life is impressive and should last for several days of light use.The phone received two software updates after the initial setup and, at the time of review (December 18, 2022), is running Android 12 with the April 5, 2022 security update. The software is responsive and is close to a stock Android experience. There isn\\'t really any bloatware installed, and the few apps that Umidigi included are there to take advantage of the phone\\'s unique hardware features.Overall, the Bison GT2 packs a lot of features and value for the price. If you\\'re looking for a reasonably-priced and ruggedized phone with a huge battery, it\\'s a good option.

First my confession: I have washed two phones in the washing machine and all it takes is a second or two and the phone is ruined. I did not expect to find anything bulletproof that would have a decent camera, so I set out reading about all the usual phones and only started looking at rugged models late in the search. I read something about UMIDIGI being an unusual Chinese phone manufacturer because they were building phones for construction sites, logging operations, mines and other places where work would be hard on the handheld. I read through the literature on their phones. I was literally about 50 hours into my search when I figured I could then apply one of my rules: wherever possible get the most ROM and RAM you can afford. This rule has served me well with tablets. I went with 8 gigs of ROM, 128 gigs of storage, 64 megapixels camera, and software that promised to impmrove my nighttime photos. At this stage I wasn\\'t thinking that I might find a waterproof or ruggedized camera with all that ability. I think I found it. This beast feels a bit like a brick in my hand. It weighs 290 grams, about 10 ounces. If it survives a single wash it will pay for itself instantly. I like the camera and find that it does a decent job in deep shadows and nighttime without using the flash. I am pleased with the purchase and look forward to getting to know it better. So far I have set up the facial recognition, but haven\\'t got the fingerprint working properly. I didn\\'t buy it for either of those features, so if I get them working I will consider it a bonus. i would like to throw the camera into the washing machine to see if it can survive the ordeal, but my wife won\\'t let me. 4.5. FYI, nothing tells you this: the Sim tray slides out, no sim key required. So far so good. Pleased with this purchase and the price I got it at. Home screen is more Motorola than Samsung so that way of organizing icons will take a little getting used to. Set up was easy and other than cosmetic differences, if you\\'ve run an android device/phone before, you\\'ll be able to navigate without problems. Noticeably bigger than my previous Samsung but it doesn\\'t feel wrong. Fits comfortably in the hand and the additional weight is not a problem. Feels sturdy. Nice screen. Surprisingly pleased by the sound quality and volume. Did not use the fingerprint reader as the button is small and a little awkward to get my finger positioned right to use.  I must say, coming off of 6 years of Samsung phones I do miss the ease of their streamlined add-free Samsung apps for email/gallery/video/music, but I\\'m sure after some trial and error with the app store and after playing around with the provided apps that I\\'ll find apps that work for me. Review after 2 weeks of usePros:-very sturdy phone.-has a headphone jack-phone doesn\\'t come with a lot of preinstalled bloatware-Battery life is pretty good, only had to charge it once in the 2 weeks of testing the phone with light use.-camera is good given the price range, don\\'t expect picture quality any where close to 1k$ flagship phones-Can probably run most games on the app store, I\\'ve tried genshin Impact and its playable but the framerate isn\\'t the best, prob around 20fps during action.Cons:-touch latency isn\\'t the best, if you want to game on it, especially if your into rhythm games.-phone doesn\\'t lie flat and will have a slight wobble to it due to a notch on the bottom side where the usb-c port is-speakers are at the back, so audio isn\\'t projected at you when watching videos and it can get covered if it\\'s on a surface or you are holding it in portrait mode.-gets pretty hot where the camera is when gaming on it for extended periods. I am using it to phone my contacts I bought the first one and found some debris under the screen protector film, then returned it back. With the nice email from UMIDIGI customer service, I decided to make another try. The second one I received has been working for one and half month. It\\'s really a great phone!Powerful battery can last two days even watching movies,videos. The feeling of hand holding is comfortable. The smart keys design makes it more easy when you need to run some functions more often. Multiple apps in tool box are pretty handy.I still have a lot about the phone to explore, but so far I\\'m satisfied with it. For this reason, I\\'ve bought a third one for my family.

Takes alright pictures, does not allow you to speed up videos. I do a lot of videos for my crafting so not having all the usual android options for pictures/videos kind of sucks.

This is not a premium phone by any means, camera are barely ok, bezels are giants and speed is just okay for everyday tasks. But the built quality, screen quality, battery capacity and the fact that everything is included for $270 Cdn make this a great deal for a spare phone for people like me who spend half of their lives on the road. Way better value than a A series Samsung of the same price that doesn\\'t include a case, screen protector and charger.

Used in the swimming pool a few times, definitely waterproof. Speakerphone volume is decent. Photo quality cannot be compared to expensive phones, but meets my needs. However, I love the ultra wide angle photos that\\'s not even offered in many expensive phones, I can take wide pics even at a close distance. The FM radio without headphones/cables is perfect for listening to radio without data through bluetooth earphones. Brightness is very nice that I can actually dim it to very dark for use in nighttime. Battery life is very good, can use it for 2 days straight.Everything is great for my needs, with exception of some software issues. The phone shutdown by itself a few times, and would enter a restart loop when I try to start it. After some testing, I learnt that I can break the restart loop by pressing power + volume down button for some 20 seconds.

I purchased 3 other Umidigi phones in the past and everyone I had used always had some quirks that made them hard to recommend. This phone overall is great for what it is. Battery lasts 2 days with heavy usage. Bison GT2 is speedy and performs great for all the tasks I need it to. If there would be any negatives about the product the phone itself is quite heavy based on the heavy-duty construction and the case itself is quite slippery.For a budget phone, I would strongly recommend it.  This would be a great phone for kids/teens because it can take abuse and it hits a low price point so if they do wreck it after a year you can just get them another one. ä»¥å\\x89\\x8dã\\x81®ã\\x82¹ã\\x83\\x9eã\\x83\\x9bã\\x81\\x8cæ©\\x9fè\\x83½ä¸\\x8dè¶³ã\\x81«ã\\x81ªã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x81\\x9fã\\x82\\x81è³¼å\\x85¥ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81¾ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x80\\x82å¿\\x85è¦\\x81å\\x8d\\x81å\\x88\\x86ã\\x81ªæ©\\x9fè\\x83½ã\\x81\\x8cæ\\x95´ã\\x81£ã\\x81¦ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81¦ã\\x80\\x81ä¾¡æ\\xa0¼ä»¥ä¸\\x8aã\\x81®ã\\x81\\x8aå¾\\x97æ\\x84\\x9fã\\x81\\x8cã\\x81\\x82ã\\x82\\x8aã\\x81¾ã\\x81\\x99ã\\x80\\x82é\\x9b»æº\\x90ã\\x82¹ã\\x82¤ã\\x83\\x83ã\\x83\\x81ã\\x81\\x8cæ\\x8c\\x87ç´\\x8bã\\x82»ã\\x83³ã\\x82µã\\x83¼ã\\x82\\x92å\\x85¼ã\\x81\\xadã\\x81¦ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81®ã\\x81\\x8cç\\x89¹å¾´ã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x99ã\\x80\\x82 I\\'ve had this phone for 2 weeks now. The camera is great, it\\'s got lots of storage plus a dual SIM card tray that you can have 2 Sim cards or one plus a memory card to add even more. I\\'ve dropped the phone twice and got it pretty wet once. No problem. All this for under $300. My last phone cost $1100 and I\\'m happier with my new Bison 2 Pro. So I am prone to dropping my phone and they stop working. Well I got a few weeks ago and we\\'ll luck would have it I have dropped it on the ground and in the pool and it still a live and working the same. I hope it stays that way for a few years. Robusto e bello con un software poco pratico Great phone as long as you don\\'t need to take a pic of anything. Absolutely no focus unless you use ultra wide angel, and with that setting there is no zoom etc. With video, it starts in focus and then looses it within a few seconds. Also, the watermark is turned off but then shows up in half the pics anyway. And as for 48mp on the camera, without decent software that might as well be 2mp. Such a let down. Genuinely the worst camera I have ever used , 15 years ago Samsung phones had better photos than this. Bought this phone needing a replacement for my Samsung. The phone is very nice looks good and is tough. The only thing I\\'m having issue with is the Google pay only works sporadically. Only a minor issue. Works fine, nice volume, and looks nice It is not the G95 as advertised more the G90 ...MT6785. When you look up the specs it\\'s the G90.  For the price I will keep the phone. But they should change the description at least. I had a problem and the company I purchased it from helped me greatly! Thank YOU! Been using the Bison 2 Pro for a couple of weeks now and am very happy with the way the phone has performed. Phone came almost with a full charge, inserted Sim card and it hooked up to the Telus network with no issues. Connected to the internet, phone downloaded update and installed. Has worked flawlessly since. Love the two customizable quick access buttons. To change functions go to settings and then Smart Key tab. Chose this phone for the water/dust resistant and the built in armoured case. This should eliminate the majority of phone failures, fingers crossed. The phone has handled every program and game I\\'ve needed so far. Not sure how Umidigi manufactures such a great phone at such a reasonable price point. Would not hesitate to recommend this phone to anyone that needs a great mid range phone (which are the majority of people). Final quick summary fantastic battery life, decent camera, headphone jack, handy included apps (see pic) but no added bloat ware, Android 12, lots of memory, with option of adding an SD card, and a good processor, all wrapped up in a water resistant case, at a price point that if the phone somehow breaks I won\\'t be to upset. Bought a second phone the same, now my wife and I have the same phone. Takes awesome pictures and video. ã\\x83\\xadã\\x83\\x83ã\\x82¯ç\\x94»é\\x9d¢ã\\x81§ã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x8dã\\x82\\x8bæ\\x93\\x8dä½\\x9cã\\x81\\x8cã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x8dã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x84ç\\x94»é\\x9d¢ã\\x81®æ\\x98\\x8eã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81\\x95ã\\x82\\x92ä¸\\x8bã\\x81\\x92ã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81¨å\\x8b\\x9dæ\\x89\\x8bã\\x81«æ\\x98\\x8eã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81ªã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x82\\x8aæ\\x9a\\x97ã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81ªã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x82\\x8aã\\x81\\x99ã\\x82\\x8bBluetoothã\\x81®é\\x9f³é\\x87\\x8fã\\x81\\x8cå¤\\x89ã\\x81\\x88ã\\x82\\x89ã\\x82\\x8cã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81ªã\\x82\\x8bã\\x82¿ã\\x83\\x83ã\\x83\\x81æ\\x84\\x9fåº¦ã\\x81\\x8cæ\\x82ªã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81¦æ\\x93\\x8dä½\\x9cã\\x81\\x8cã\\x81\\x8aã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81ªã\\x82\\x8b ã\\x81ªã\\x82\\x93ã\\x81\\x8bæ\\x99®é\\x80\\x9aã\\x81«è²·ã\\x81£ã\\x81¦è\\x89¯ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x80\\x82ã\\x80\\x82ã\\x80\\x82 Pretty good phone.

The phone is well made and works as it should.Good battery.Good camera.What I don\\'t like about it is the software. The software is very messy, maybe not made for this phone. For example, the location of the phone turns on when it wants and cannot be stopped. Overall, this is the worst software I\\'ve ever seen on a phone. It comes with screen film and case, and my dad loves it.

This phone has a ton of features not found on your \"mainstream\" phones for anywhere near the price. Underwater camera, FM radio, NFC, thermometer, 64M camera, macro camera etc..You name it this has it.It even has a dedicated button for the underwater camera so you don\\'t accidentally click somewhere else under water. I took a few pictures from underwater in the sink just to test it out and they look great.It is very responsive and everything just seems to work.The battery life is great easily lasts the whole day and sometimes a couple.Oh did I mention it is also drop resistant up to I think a meter and a half, I didn\\'t test that yet but it seems like it would take it.If you are looking for a new phone and aren\\'t afraid of trying a new brand then I would say to take a chance pick up one of these. You won\\'t be disappointed. I really like the build of the phone. It feels sturdy, has a nice screen, and is pretty snappy when it\\'s not glitching. The screen becomes unresponsive to commands throughout the day, which is really frustrating. I would have kept it if the it didn\\'t constantly glitch.

It\\'s bigger than most, corners are beefed up with quality rubber and metal encases the phone. It\\'s rugged and sturdy and beautiful all at the same time. You know this phone was built for the outdoor enthusiast!Water proof, dust proof and can last 30 minutes under water at a depth ofalmost 5 ft. It takes underwater videos and pictures with a special dedicated button on side of phone, now is that incredible or what!If you like hunting, camping, hiking,fishing, boating or just going to the beach with your kids this phone is a must.With a 64mp main camera, 24 mp selfie. You are going to get some incredible shots at the beach and in the water!This phone has so many features if you are the least bit interested go online and take in all the specs and details this Bison GT2 has to offer at an incredible price, especially for all the features that are packed into its case. Bought this for my husband who is very rough on his things.  He gets extremely frustrated with slow or sluggish running devices as well.  So far the phone has survived him using/abusing it, even at work.  I don\\'t hear him yelling at it or poking angrily at it like he did his previous phones by other brands, so I\\'m assuming that the processing speed is enough for him.  It was difficult to install the SIM card in this phone though.

It seems to be weak.It is heavy, but I guess that\\'s what you get with a beefy case and large battery. It seems to be very responsive . Its not 5G but for me that is OK. I have been nothing but very impressed with this phone. It worked great right out of the box and is better than my older Samsung. It is solid and ruggedly built, the apps work good with no locking up. Battery life is great. The camera takes good photos, perhaps not as good as phones costing 4x as much, but still good photos. Android runs very well on it and the processor is quite fast. I owned a Umidigi phone 3 years ago and was very impressed at how much their products have improved. I would definitely buy another. Just received it. Easy to set up and transfer apps and data from old cell to this one. Set up quick. Battery life incredible, solid made, little heavy but not overly difficult to use. Fast speed.  So far very good. And cost very reasonable for the capabilities of the phone. Awesome phone with tons of features.Its big and  its rugged and feels good to hold.Runs everything I want and does not skip a beat!I love the outdoors campimg and bushcraft. I still jave not dropped it off a cliff but feel goid knowing it will survie a drop in the creek.The camera is awesome and I like the analog connect for headphones. No case needed.I find the sound on the speaker a bit metalic 2 speakers would be better.Goid old fashioned phone calls are clear.Needs more colour options if you want some flavour.My favouritr phone and second from Umidigi. æ\\x9b¸ã\\x81\\x8dè¾¼ã\\x81¿ã\\x80\\x81èª\\xadã\\x81¿è¾¼ã\\x81¿é\\x80\\x9fåº¦ã\\x81¯å\\x89\\x8dä¸\\x96ä»£å\\x89\\x8dã\\x83¬ã\\x83\\x99ã\\x83«ã\\x81ªã\\x81®ã\\x81§é«\\x98ç\\x94»è³ªå\\x8b\\x95ç\\x94»ä¿\\x9då\\xad\\x98ã\\x82\\x84ã\\x80\\x81é«\\x98è§£å\\x83\\x8fåº¦ã\\x81®ã\\x82²ã\\x83¼ã\\x83\\xa0ã\\x81«ã\\x81¯å\\x90\\x91ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x84ã\\x80\\x82ç\\x94¨é\\x80\\x94ã\\x81¨ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81¦ã\\x81¯ã\\x82¢ã\\x82¦ã\\x83\\x88ã\\x83\\x89ã\\x82¢ã\\x81§ã\\x81®ä½¿ç\\x94¨ã\\x81ªã\\x82\\x89å\\x95\\x8fé¡\\x8cã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x84ã\\x82³ã\\x83³ã\\x82»ã\\x83\\x97ã\\x83\\x88ã\\x81\\x8cã\\x82¢ã\\x82¦ã\\x83\\x88ã\\x83\\x89ã\\x82¢ã\\x81£ã\\x81½ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81®ã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x9dã\\x81®é\\x80\\x9aã\\x82\\x8aã\\x81ªã\\x81®ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x82\\x82ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x82\\x8cã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81\\x8cã\\x80\\x823å¹´å\\x89\\x8dè³¼å\\x85¥ã\\x81®ä»\\x96ç¤¾SIMã\\x83\\x95ã\\x83ªã\\x83¼ã\\x81®2ä¸\\x87å\\x86\\x86å\\x8f°ã\\x80\\x8164ã\\x82®ã\\x82¬(æ®\\x8bå®¹é\\x87\\x8f2ã\\x82®ã\\x82¬)ã\\x81®ã\\x82\\x82ã\\x81®ã\\x81®æ\\x96¹ã\\x81\\x8cæ\\x9b¸ã\\x81\\x8dè¾¼ã\\x81¿èª\\xadã\\x81¿è¾¼ã\\x81¿ã\\x81\\x8cæ\\x97©ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81®ã\\x81\\x8cã\\x81¡ã\\x82\\x87ã\\x81£ã\\x81¨è\\x80\\x83ã\\x81\\x88ã\\x81\\x95ã\\x81\\x9bã\\x82\\x89ã\\x82\\x8cã\\x82\\x8bã\\x80\\x82è¨\\x98æ\\x86¶å®¹é\\x87\\x8fã\\x81¯å¤§ã\\x81\\x8dã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81\\x91ã\\x81©ã\\x80\\x81ã\\x80\\x81ã\\x80\\x81 I disliked that there was the phone brand water mark on ever single picture I took.  I didnâ\\x80\\x99t investigate the phone any further after I realized this. Did not come with earphone cable other then that great phone for the price I\\'ve had the phone for almost 3 weeks now and so far so good. I like that the corners have a rubbery coating and are extra thick to protect it against falls. I like the textured back but would like greater texture for a better grip in my hand. The camera is decent for an android phone and also takes good macros. I haven\\'t tried out the underwater camera yet because it\\'s winter here. The price is amazing and unbeatable for the amount of RAM and memory that you get. My only complaint is that the phone is a little too long. Phone freezes everyday a few times a day. Just got it 5 days ago. Can\\'t accept every message like a picture text. Camera isn\\'t the best.Battery is great. Last the whole day. It does seem to take awhile to charge tho.Other than that it\\'s ok.I feel a strong current or something when I use this phone and it hurts my chest because thats where I use the phone closest. Feels like I\\'m being fried somehow thru this phone. Straight thru the nipples and sternum . If I die or get cancer soon it\\'s from this phone . I\\'d be curious to know the amount of frequency\\'s this phone emitts TÃ©lÃ©phone et internet mais souvent l\\'Ã©cran s\\'Ã©teignait soudainement et en voulant rÃ©pondre au tÃ©lÃ©phone ! if you plan to connect your phone with your Car\\'s Android Auto then this phone is not for you.If you plan to connect your phone through an HDMI connection, then this phone is not for you.If you plan to take lots of pics and vids, then this phone is not for you. Although it advertises great Megapixels, that\\'s not the only thing that makes a camera great. The processing of the camera is garbage.The temperature app , the FM radio app, the memory and the battery are the best features of the phone, but I just needed the phone to do a little more which it failed to do. Returning this phone as it didn\\'t meet my needs. I really like this phone.Pros:- Rugged. This phone feels indestructible.- Huge Battery. Lasts for days- Fingerprint reader is side-mounted. I hate in-screen fingerprint readers and much prefer the side-mounted variety.- Physical shortcut buttons. Super-convenient access to my most-used functions. I have one set for flashlight and another for the camera- Headphone jack!!- Speakers are very loudCons:- Heavy and thick. This is expected in such a rugged phone.- Slow charging. This is expected. A battery that is double the size should take twice as long to charge. Easy to setup and nice and fast..

I loved pretty much everything this UMIDIGI bison 2 pro cellphone has to offer from its durable strength,waterproof, dustproof, temperature monitor, compass and lots of ram and storage space, great value for the money. I can\\'t even begin with this trash. It was buggy from the start with the camera acting up and such and, though we contacted support, we were stalled for days until the return window closed then I get this nice email telling me that they can only offer support and will not replace the device.It was not damaged in any way and we never tried to flash a ROM or do anything outside of standard settings until they instructed us to try.Buy another phone, save yourself HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS in regret. Easy to use. Like size. Battery life great. Got the phone. Popped my sim in (koodo) , doesn\\'t show a sim is detected. Popped my buddy\\'s in (freedom mobile) same thing. Popped my mother\\'s card in , same damn thing.Contacted support. They told me the card slot was likely fried , try another sim , then set the ticket to \"resolved\"Phone is good without a card , but I WANTED A PHONE NOT A FKN TABLET.

Everything was working fine. The camera is great, the processor is very fast, watching video was no problem and the phone clarity was perfect. The rugged design is exactly as promised, quite durable.However, a few days ago, when I got up from bed, it dropped from bed, on a THICK, CARPETED floor, not even a few feet. I plugged it in, but the screen WILL NOT turn on.- rebooting, didn\\'t work.- charging all night, didn\\'t work- plugging into the computer, didn\\'t workNOTHING WORKSThe pic included is what happens when you plug it it: NOTHING.I am a fair person, so until the manufacturer honors the warranty, it\\'ll have to stay at the 1-star rating. This is only a 3 MONTH old phone, so contact me asap. After many decades of buying samsung, I finally jumped ship - so to speak - and picked this model instead. First of all my UNlocked phone was locked when I purchased a pay-as-you-goH2o [ATT] sim for my galaxy a50 as we rarely have phone OR data coverage when we are in Michigan, a Great Lakes state that we visit often. Right now our current provider Mint Mobile, never has reception in Michigan! After using the h2o sim in my a50, my phone didn\\'t work as before and it took several looong tedious hours working with Mint before we finally discovered that h2o - via ATT - LOCKED our phone! We have gotten in touch with h20 AND ATT and neither has been human-enuff to contact us abt our problem! JERKs! I went ahead and got a new and very reasonably priced and DURABLE  phone - it bounced out of my pocket today as we were running - and not even a crack or a scratch! AmAzing!! I also can vouch for the customer service of the phone\\'s company UMIDIGI. Granted, I would love to use an USA-made phone, but none offer all that\\'s in this phone! As I am a photographer and am outdoors often, I am amazed that this phone is equipped with an altimeter and barometer to give appropriate apps the ability to use that data. Also, this is the first phone in decades that I didn\\'t need to search for a needle to access my sim holder! My a50 also offered fingerprint sign-in, but it was such a hassle I disabled it within a few days. This on the other hand, is so easy and accurate, I have used it everyday and will NOT disable it!! Sure there are a few issues and the company\\'s customer service has been very quick in responding, plus  have been so patient with me and are willing to work with me on the few issues I do have. Getting a new phone is a hassle in itself, but one that is completely different to what I\\'m accustomed to makes it a bit more tedious, BUT I am really enjoying my Bison GT2! Even at medium resolution of 48mp I am getting a resolution of 16:9 of 9216x5184, and at the highest resolution of 64mp at 4:3 at 9280x6944 which is nothing LESS than amazing! To ANY photographer, this is awesome and incredible resolution! I love the imagery I am getting, plus the feel of this protected phone - LOVE the bumpers on the corners! As I continue to explore and discover my Bison GT2, I will update!UPDATE 6Mar2023 & NEW GT2: Had my GT2 swapped with a jes-arrived new one. Now with a bit of experience with the brand, I went out to test it right away. Gone are all the problems experienced with the first GT2. ALL images in every mode are beautYful and sharp. The phone functions as advertised and more. Other problems not tested as much on original phone has NOT appeared in this phone. Granted, I have only had this phone a few hours now but everything\\'s MUCH better. It\\'s an incredible phone with great capability. I plan to use as much time available/possible to test it thoroughly, and on this phone, even the OTG function worked right off the bat with NO problems, unlike the \"other\" phone that required a LOT of work! The only thing I need to adapt to, is the saying SHOOT or SMILE to take a picture; unlike ALL of my previous Samsung phones this android doesn\\'t do that, and voice-activated cam apps aren\\'t as good as the samsung voice-activated cam app. I\\'d like to thank the awesome customer-support which has been incredible over the time they attended to many problems with the first phone!14mar2023: The FM radio works perfectly with NO wifi or antenna (headphones plugged in) required!!! Thermometer works great on skin readings and objects! Just discovered taking a pix, the up/down volume works to snap a pix. Because there are so many \"knobs\" on the phone\\'s sides, need to be very careful how you use/hold the phone. If you have a phone holder, it may work very nicely to avoid pressing on the side buttons. I\\'ve been using this phone for a week now and this thing is pretty impressive.Umidigi has put together quite the package here, even if it\\'s not targeted as an \\'every persons\\' phone.Although I\\'m not quite sure why not. Well, I guess it\\'s because it\\'s bigger and heavier than what most people equate with luxury.Which is kinda silly since they take their beautiful work of art fragile slim phones and jam them into a bulky case to protect them.Guess what, Umidigi has already done that for you and included a battery big enough to actually get you through a full day without even breathing hard.Seriously, it\\'s pretty hard to kill this battery during a normal day+ worth of useage.So much is packed into this phone, I don\\'t really have time to comment on everything in this review, the only thing kinda missing would be 5G support - but guess what, there is a version that has 5G support fo just a few dollars more if that is a feature yo cannot live without.There are not one, but two fully configurable buttons to play with, an underwater camera (which I haven\\'t been able to test yet, looking forward to it), and some really helpful sub funtions contained in the \\'toolbox\\' app.Things like a noise test, bubble level, magnifier, picture hanger, protractor, and the ever handy thermometer that I\\'ve come to enjoy having on Umidigi phones.As you can see from the pictures, this phone is built like a tank, and they aren\\'t bashful about it at all. You can see that they took some care in designing it for rugged use with probabaly not the the cleanest of hands or environments. The buttons stick out a bit, are differntly sized for easy identification and have a satisfying \\'click\\' to them when actuated.I\\'ve had no problems with WiFi stability or cell connection while using an AT&T mvno - signal has been strong and as stable as other phones in my possession.Calls are clear and the speakers are powerful enough to cut through loud and clear. One interesting piece here is that what is typically the bottom speaker actually fires out of the back of the phone.This struck me as weird at first - it\\'s a different design that we\\'re used to - it actually works quite well in practice. Plus, one less fragile item on the edge of the phone to break when you inevitably drop it.Which I have. I was going to do it on purpose to test the claims, but I\\'m a klutz and didn\\'t have to. I was eating and of course, knocked it off the table onto a tile floor. Glad to say that other than a small smudge on the protective trim it came through the ordeal just fine.Pretty sure if I was outside and bounced it off the concrete, it would suffer a few more scratches, but that\\'s probably it. Like I said earlier - this phone is built to shrug off abuse.I mentioned earlier that it is a bit heavy, which is due in part to the oversized battery (6,180 MAH) and the extra hardening. I find the extra heft an added bonus as it makes the phone, for me, easier to handle and grip. It\\'s not like we\\'re talking an extra pound or two in your hand, just a couple of ounces - which really is nothing.Yes, you can also feel the extra heft in your pocket - but hey, a t least you know somebody hasn\\'t pick-pocketed it off of you ;)To wrap up this mini-review, if you\\'re looking for a phone to use on the jobsite, are a klutz, looking for true all day battery life, or are just tired of paying a premium for ultra fragile all glass phones - this should definitely be on your list of phones to consider. It\\'s seldom that I play games on a mobile device. Back in the day, perhaps... But not much in the past few years. This being a gaming phone, however, I thought would be perfect for me. Initially, I was really looking for a phone with a long lasting battery, and during my search, I realized that phone cameras have really come a long way since my previous phone was out of the box. So, after finding the Bison GT2 , I was impressed with the specs. And, as I know no one with this phone, I figured \"why not?\". I did the iPhone 7 for the past two years and Samsung Galaxy for years before that. It\\'s time to get away from the main competitors. Both Samsung and Apple can suck it! Not only that, but after unboxing this phone...I fell in love with it right away! Of course, I had missed having an Android, but more than that, I needed something a bit more rugged that could withstand everyday mishaps and gravity, and as it stands, gravity and I are not the greatest of friends. So far, I am very pleased with the phone itself.As for the OS, I\\'ve always been more of an Android person since having had my first smartphone. I hated the iOS on the iPhone 7. That having been a free phone, I won\\'t complain... Except that I really did not like it.The battery on this phone has lived up to my expectations and I am very very pleased with just how long it does last. And the photos I\\'ve taken so far look absolutely phenomenal. I have noticed, though, that it\\'s only taking 48mp photos, which are still far superior than any phone cameras I\\'ve had...But still, I do wonder. It being a 64mp camera, how do I take 64mp photos? Is it something in the settings?Either way, I am very pleased with this phone and everything that goes with it. No sleekness, it won\\'t slip out of my hands, I don\\'t fear crushing it just trying to get it out of my back pocket, and I am confident in that it may even help make amends between gravity and I. I feel as though this phone was made specifically for me. I would definitely do business with Umidigi again, if needed!Thank you! my carrier did not support this device all major cell carriers DO NOT support this device find out if your cell carrier supports this device I did not now I am stuck with an unusable device and still have to use my old device good cost but no wear is the caution of being incompatible with most cell carriers I could not even change to a new carrier no one supports this device Bison 2 Pro, it may have more Rom, than it\\'s twin.Sometimes, it\\'s  glitchy and screen hard respond to touch.  Its a good phone, but not for me.  It\\'s better than Motorola.  No bloat ware, like the majority of cells. The phone stays cool, unlike Motorola.  Works with Mint Mobile.  It has boosting for apps.  Better than Samsung, and most major cell phone. Updated Review - After UMIDIGI Customer Care Representative contacted me by the name of Vicky, they assisted me in resolving my issue and granted me a partial refund. Because of their Excellent Customer Care Service I will definitely give them a 5 out of 5. Thank you to UMIDIGI and Vicky. I appreciate this greatly.This phone does not work with Trinidad and Tobago TSTT Sim Card!! 3 Days in with Mild/Moderate usage.Pro\\'s- Large Android Based Smart Phone- Feels Rugged and Buttons seem to work Flawlessly- Battery Life - Came with 97% when I opened the box on Friday. Phone set up, Charging my Apple Phone while setting up, Logging into accounts, updating phone and apps + Playing with settings and options phone still has 24% battery on Monday Morning. Approx. 7 hours of Facebook scrolling and video watching is included in the usage.Con\\'s- Clock in the upper left corner is cut off- Screen is a little too sensitive, will respond to a hovering finger- Unlocking system seems to be a weird Although the phone feels kind of big and unwieldy in your hand, it also feels durable and tough. It does not feel like a modern $900+ smartphone, but it also feels way less fragile; it feels heavy and plasticky. I wish the camera bump didn\\'t stick out so much and i wish the phone as a whole was smaller, but otherwise i have no complaints about the shape of the phone. The \"rubber\" corner bumpers are not actual rubber, they are just a softer plastic.The screen brightness is good, not great. the speakers are very loud and actually sound pretty great. You can use the FM radio without plugin in wired headphones. I get great 4G connection with AT&T, and i have no issues with any other connections (GPS, NFC, Bluetooth, Ect). The finger print sensor seems to work better than many other budget phone\\'s fingerprint sensors. You have to turn on the 90hrz refresh rate manually in settings, but the phone looks super smooth if you do. The battery life is decent if you have the 90hrz turned on, and its much better if you do not. Pretty much stock android with only 2 bloatware apps (\"tools\" and zelle). The extra two physical buttons are useful and well implemented; they are flush with the phone\\'s frame, making them unlikely to be accidentally pressed. The cameras are fine, they are high megapixel shooters, but the software seems poorly implemented, so the overall quality is somewhat lacking. The GPU/CPU/RAM are good enough that the phone never stutters and feels quite smooth during regular use.Overall, the phone is smaller than a normal phone with a high end protective case. it has some nice extra features, and everything is pretty well implemented. I\\'ve had no quality control issues with my device, and the seller seems responsive. Its not a flagship phone, but its pretty solid. I use UMIDIGI Bison a year and a half . Excellent durability ! Hope this one be the same . Only hesitate about navigation - previous model in NYC work only when speed is lower 10 miles and gives a lot or wrong direction loosing GPS on all bridges and in narrow streets of city. This is much better . Fast camera focus . stable GPS connection .  Only fingerprint sensor located on On/Off key is not good for me . The phone itself is nice!.. itâ\\x80\\x99s durable and functions how you need it. Yet unfortunately I was under the impression that itâ\\x80\\x99d work with straight talk. But straight talk doesnâ\\x80\\x99t recognize this model.. I have to return this product solely on that. After many decades of buying samsung, I finally jumped ship - so to speak - and picked this model instead. First of all my UNlocked phone was locked when I purchased a pay-as-you-goH2o [ATT] sim for my galaxy a50 as we rarely have phone OR data coverage when we are in Michigan, a Great Lakes state that we visit often. Right now our current provider Mint Mobile, never has reception in Michigan! After using the h2o sim in my a50, my phone didn\\'t work as before and it took several looong tedious hours working with Mint before we finally discovered that h2o - via ATT - LOCKED our phone! We have gotten in touch with h20 AND ATT and neither has been human-enuff to contact us abt our problem! JERKs! I went ahead and got a new and very reasonably priced and DURABLE  phone - it bounced out of my pocket today as we were running - and not even a crack or a scratch! AmAzing!! I also can vouch for the customer service of the phone\\'s company UMIDIGI. Granted, I would love to use an USA-made phone, but none offer all that\\'s in this phone! As I am a photographer and am outdoors often, I am amazed that this phone is equipped with an altimeter and barometer to give appropriate apps the ability to use that data. Also, this is the first phone in decades that I didn\\'t need to search for a needle to access my sim holder! My a50 also offered fingerprint sign-in, but it was such a hassle I disabled it within a few days. This on the other hand, is so easy and accurate, I have used it everyday and will NOT disable it!! Sure there are a few issues and the company\\'s customer service has been very quick in responding, plus  have been so patient with me and are willing to work with me on the few issues I do have. Getting a new phone is a hassle in itself, but one that is completely different to what I\\'m accustomed to makes it a bit more tedious, BUT I am really enjoying my Bison GT2! Even at medium resolution of 48mp I am getting a resolution of 16:9 of 9216x5184, and at the highest resolution of 64mp at 4:3 at 9280x6944 which is nothing LESS than amazing! To ANY photographer, this is awesome and incredible resolution! I love the imagery I am getting, plus the feel of this protected phone - LOVE the bumpers on the corners! As I continue to explore and discover my Bison GT2, I will update!UPDATE 6Mar2023 & NEW GT2: Had my GT2 swapped with a jes-arrived new one. Now with a bit of experience with the brand, I went out to test it right away. Gone are all the problems experienced with the first GT2. ALL images in every mode are beautYful and sharp. The phone functions as advertised and more. Other problems not tested as much on original phone has NOT appeared in this phone. Granted, I have only had this phone a few hours now but everything\\'s MUCH better. It\\'s an incredible phone with great capability. I plan to use as much time available/possible to test it thoroughly, and on this phone, even the OTG function worked right off the bat with NO problems, unlike the \"other\" phone that required a LOT of work! The only thing I need to adapt to, is the saying SHOOT or SMILE to take a picture; unlike ALL of my previous Samsung phones this android doesn\\'t do that, and voice-activated cam apps aren\\'t as good as the samsung voice-activated cam app. I\\'d like to thank the awesome customer-support which has been incredible over the time they attended to many problems with the first phone!14mar2023: The FM radio works perfectly with NO wifi or antenna (headphones plugged in) required!!! Thermometer works great on skin readings and objects! Just discovered taking a pix, the up/down volume works to snap a pix. Because there are so many \"knobs\" on the phone\\'s sides, need to be very careful how you use/hold the phone. If you have a phone holder, it may work very nicely to avoid pressing on the side buttons. I\\'ve been using this phone for a week now and this thing is pretty impressive.Umidigi has put together quite the package here, even if it\\'s not targeted as an \\'every persons\\' phone.Although I\\'m not quite sure why not. Well, I guess it\\'s because it\\'s bigger and heavier than what most people equate with luxury.Which is kinda silly since they take their beautiful work of art fragile slim phones and jam them into a bulky case to protect them.Guess what, Umidigi has already done that for you and included a battery big enough to actually get you through a full day without even breathing hard.Seriously, it\\'s pretty hard to kill this battery during a normal day+ worth of useage.So much is packed into this phone, I don\\'t really have time to comment on everything in this review, the only thing kinda missing would be 5G support - but guess what, there is a version that has 5G support fo just a few dollars more if that is a feature yo cannot live without.There are not one, but two fully configurable buttons to play with, an underwater camera (which I haven\\'t been able to test yet, looking forward to it), and some really helpful sub funtions contained in the \\'toolbox\\' app.Things like a noise test, bubble level, magnifier, picture hanger, protractor, and the ever handy thermometer that I\\'ve come to enjoy having on Umidigi phones.As you can see from the pictures, this phone is built like a tank, and they aren\\'t bashful about it at all. You can see that they took some care in designing it for rugged use with probabaly not the the cleanest of hands or environments. The buttons stick out a bit, are differntly sized for easy identification and have a satisfying \\'click\\' to them when actuated.I\\'ve had no problems with WiFi stability or cell connection while using an AT&T mvno - signal has been strong and as stable as other phones in my possession.Calls are clear and the speakers are powerful enough to cut through loud and clear. One interesting piece here is that what is typically the bottom speaker actually fires out of the back of the phone.This struck me as weird at first - it\\'s a different design that we\\'re used to - it actually works quite well in practice. Plus, one less fragile item on the edge of the phone to break when you inevitably drop it.Which I have. I was going to do it on purpose to test the claims, but I\\'m a klutz and didn\\'t have to. I was eating and of course, knocked it off the table onto a tile floor. Glad to say that other than a small smudge on the protective trim it came through the ordeal just fine.Pretty sure if I was outside and bounced it off the concrete, it would suffer a few more scratches, but that\\'s probably it. Like I said earlier - this phone is built to shrug off abuse.I mentioned earlier that it is a bit heavy, which is due in part to the oversized battery (6,180 MAH) and the extra hardening. I find the extra heft an added bonus as it makes the phone, for me, easier to handle and grip. It\\'s not like we\\'re talking an extra pound or two in your hand, just a couple of ounces - which really is nothing.Yes, you can also feel the extra heft in your pocket - but hey, a t least you know somebody hasn\\'t pick-pocketed it off of you ;)To wrap up this mini-review, if you\\'re looking for a phone to use on the jobsite, are a klutz, looking for true all day battery life, or are just tired of paying a premium for ultra fragile all glass phones - this should definitely be on your list of phones to consider. It\\'s seldom that I play games on a mobile device. Back in the day, perhaps... But not much in the past few years. This being a gaming phone, however, I thought would be perfect for me. Initially, I was really looking for a phone with a long lasting battery, and during my search, I realized that phone cameras have really come a long way since my previous phone was out of the box. So, after finding the Bison GT2 , I was impressed with the specs. And, as I know no one with this phone, I figured \"why not?\". I did the iPhone 7 for the past two years and Samsung Galaxy for years before that. It\\'s time to get away from the main competitors. Both Samsung and Apple can suck it! Not only that, but after unboxing this phone...I fell in love with it right away! Of course, I had missed having an Android, but more than that, I needed something a bit more rugged that could withstand everyday mishaps and gravity, and as it stands, gravity and I are not the greatest of friends. So far, I am very pleased with the phone itself.As for the OS, I\\'ve always been more of an Android person since having had my first smartphone. I hated the iOS on the iPhone 7. That having been a free phone, I won\\'t complain... Except that I really did not like it.The battery on this phone has lived up to my expectations and I am very very pleased with just how long it does last. And the photos I\\'ve taken so far look absolutely phenomenal. I have noticed, though, that it\\'s only taking 48mp photos, which are still far superior than any phone cameras I\\'ve had...But still, I do wonder. It being a 64mp camera, how do I take 64mp photos? Is it something in the settings?Either way, I am very pleased with this phone and everything that goes with it. No sleekness, it won\\'t slip out of my hands, I don\\'t fear crushing it just trying to get it out of my back pocket, and I am confident in that it may even help make amends between gravity and I. I feel as though this phone was made specifically for me. I would definitely do business with Umidigi again, if needed!Thank you! my carrier did not support this device all major cell carriers DO NOT support this device find out if your cell carrier supports this device I did not now I am stuck with an unusable device and still have to use my old device good cost but no wear is the caution of being incompatible with most cell carriers I could not even change to a new carrier no one supports this device Bison 2 Pro, it may have more Rom, than it\\'s twin.Sometimes, it\\'s  glitchy and screen hard respond to touch.  Its a good phone, but not for me.  It\\'s better than Motorola.  No bloat ware, like the majority of cells. The phone stays cool, unlike Motorola.  Works with Mint Mobile.  It has boosting for apps.  Better than Samsung, and most major cell phone. Updated Review - After UMIDIGI Customer Care Representative contacted me by the name of Vicky, they assisted me in resolving my issue and granted me a partial refund. Because of their Excellent Customer Care Service I will definitely give them a 5 out of 5. Thank you to UMIDIGI and Vicky. I appreciate this greatly.This phone does not work with Trinidad and Tobago TSTT Sim Card!! 3 Days in with Mild/Moderate usage.Pro\\'s- Large Android Based Smart Phone- Feels Rugged and Buttons seem to work Flawlessly- Battery Life - Came with 97% when I opened the box on Friday.

But straight talk doesnâ\\x80\\x99t recognize this model.. I have to return this product solely on that. SEE REVISION BELOWâ\\x80¦So far - so good on the Bison 2Pro phone. I bought it to replace an iPhone 8 for a trip to Europe later this year. First hurdle, does it work with Verizon? Yes it does, however I havenâ\\x80\\x99t officially set it up with them, just plugged in the SIM and made a call and texted. Second hurdle, does it work with my Bluetooth hearing aids? Yes it does, beams sound directly into my headâ\\x80¦.. Next hurdle, can I adapt my brain away from the world of iPhone? Weâ\\x80\\x99ll see over the next few months. Good news, I have used Dragon Touch tablets for years and am used to Android there.I ran the battery down to 20% like the instructions say to, to break the battery in properly. I plugged the phone into a C type USB charging cable that was handy, all good. I recalled that the instructions say to use the charger provided, so I swapped to that one. AND NOTHING HAPPENED! Swapped cables with their charger, still no electrons. Swapped in a high capacity charger (maybe they want more current) and finally we are charging. Swapped in the provided cable, and still good.So the provided charger is officially DOAâ\\x80¦. I knocked the phone down a star for the inconvenience. If the seller replaces the charger, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll revisit the review and upgrade it (assuming no other faults are foundâ\\x80¦.).REVISION:After 2 weeks, the Bison screen has gone to black and white, and has started blinking on and off. The on and off behavior has no relation to touching the screen or buttons. Unacceptable. I contacted the seller about the charger being DOA, but they havenâ\\x80\\x99t replaced it. Asked questions indicating user error! Unacceptable behavior! Iâ\\x80\\x99m returning the phone for a replacement (basically, I like the phone) and weâ\\x80\\x99ll see how the next one goes. I live 20 miles from Santa Fe, NM, and depend on my phone in case of emergency. Canâ\\x80\\x99t have it crapping outâ\\x80¦â\\x80¦. Talk text would randomly stop working even when I had a strong signal or connected to Wi-Fi. So I would have to reset the phone to fix it.  It also reset a couple times on me for seemingly no reason and deleted my wallpaper.  Would not allow me to receive pictures through text but that may have just been a carrier problem I didn\\'t understand.  Other than that the size and the weight is not bad it\\'s like having a rugged case on a normal phone. I absolutely loved the look and feel of it. It certainly seemed to be a very strong phone. I just don\\'t believe it\\'s systems are reliable The Umidigi Bison GT2 is a great phone at a budget price.  The processor was able to handle my everyday needs and usage, the battery easily lasted over 2 days, and IP68 water resistance.The processor is a mid-range processor from MediaTek.  Even so, the Bison GT2 was able to handle normal usage and games.  I was able to have multiple apps open and play games with no noticeable lag. Three cameras in the back is a plus at this price. Photos turned out sharp and vibrant.  With the IP68 certification, I even took some photos underwater (backyard pool).  :-)The battery lasted forever...actually, almost 3 days of regular use.  Only negative was this made the phone a little on the thick side. The Bison GT2 comes with a built-in case that protected the phone on all sides.  I purchased a screen protector to cover the glass and keep it from scratches. My niece accidently dropped the phone on the tile floors and no visible damage. The Bison GT2 has two customizable buttons that I set to open the camera app and FM radio.  Very convenient.I highly recommend this phone as your main phone.  Would also be great is a second phone for work or main phone for kids. We had this phone roughly 2 days before it started freezing. Then it started dropping calls, and currently it wonâ\\x80\\x99t allow my husband to call out periodically. Heâ\\x80\\x99s been told people have tried calling him but it never rings nor indicates missed calls. We were excited to try it since he is a farmer and this phone has great battery life reviews. I find that the over all function is less than desired. *Update 12/31/2022Been using this for a few weeks now. So far so good. The camera isn\\'t quite up to par (I\\'m going to check settings) but all-in-all it\\'s a very solid phone for the money.Upgraded to 5 stars for the price compared to the competition. *Update 12/15/2022Customer service has been good and although you can\\'t speak to someone by phone, they are attentive via email (given time differential with China). They currently have T-Mobile activated, and I am testing the phone which seems snappy so far.  Update 11/21/2022 - currently working with the company to see if we can rectify the compatibility issue. Have updated the star rating for their attentive response, and will report back. I do not normally write reviews but this phone was disappointing.  The specs looked great but after 2 days of working with tech support (I know a fair amount about this process), the result was that this phone is incompatible with the T-Mobile network contrary to the description.  The lack of support with an off-brand like this in the U.S. is a true downfall. Unfortunately, the better known brands necessitate their higher prices because of the availability of tech support. I purchased this phone for my 13 year old son for Christmas. Long battery life, great camera, and features. Also a bonus that it\\'s everything proof, as a teenage boy is rough on gear. I had no problems adding this phone to my T-Mobile account, however it is not a 5G capable phone. The 4GLTE works great and is plenty fast enough to play games and stream also. I recommend this phone highly for a first time phone. I find the back camera doesnt have good quality even though the megapixel is a high enough, the lighting is not picked up properly, however the phone is amazing The phones durability and battery life are very good but the in-call volume is too low. Right now nothing everything is perfect. My son got one, said it was unlocked for all carriers , he has taken it to 4 different carriers none of them could the phone to work on their network. the IMEI number was invalid. This is a very rugged phone, after updating the software IMEI , seem to work fine. Se mira muy bonito e inteligente.  Pero no lo pude usar pues aunque dice que es desbloqueado, no funciono con cricket, tuve que comprar otro chip pues el original se daÃ±o. Tal vez si funcione para otras compaÃ±Ã\\xadas telefÃ³nicas. Cumple muy bien lo prometido. Recomendado para trabajÃ¡is de campo y mecÃ¡nica industrial Nice phone with heavy feel. The 64 mb camera is good for zooming in and still having high quality photos. Used it for hunting, the extra tools come in handy. You can\\'t beat this phone at the $219.99 price on Amazon now.  Excellent screen quality and snappy with 8gb of ram with the G95 processor. Rugged and a good looking phone. The Umidigi Bison GT2 impressed me with its specs and price point. After using the phone I can confirm the following important points:- outstanding camera quality- durable rugged design will prevent damage- fast speed when doing tasks on device- outstanding battery lifeThis is my second umidigi device and they keep getting more premium at a lower price point. Im a fan! I used phone for everything including couple games, sometimes battery lasted 4 days! Once in a while numbers were selected instead of letters in top row when texting but it\\'s not happening now. To anyone looking to buy this phone please be aware! I bought this through Amazon as an alternative to the HTC. It isn\\'t bad, but it is very unstable. I\\'m using AT&T. This phone will not allow the mot recent update to the phone. It goes through all of the motions to update and then shows \"error 15\". At least three times a day it crashes and turns off and on. A few people I text only show up when the data is on (none of my previous HTC phones did this). Lastly, I have turned off ALL location tracking options I can find in the system settings and under all of the apps including the emergency stuff. This phone still shows the location tracking icon everytime the scree is unlocked and then goes away. I did write the company (in China) and they basically said turn the location off. I\\'m only passing the information on. Good luck. The phone is tough and the radio works without the headphones ð\\x9f\\x8e§  also it charges fast and lasts all day This review is for Umidigi Bison GT 2, a rugged 4G phone with 8GB+128 GB Internal Storage.This is a solid phone at the price point and a great choice is you need are looking for a durable rugged phone.PROS:- Great Design and its made for outdoors.- Excellent specs that delivers great features and good performance all over.- Comes with Android 12 and it is snappy.- Have lot usable internal storage out of box and it takes an SD card to expand if there be a need.- Supports 2G, 3G and 4G on Global bands. I tested on T-Mobile US network, no issues.- Speakers are loud and clear.- Camera quality is good and it can shoot videos in 4k.- Includes FM radio and other creative features.- Comes with screen protector pre-installed.- Battery is huge and will easily last couple of days on a single charge.CONS:- Phone has some weight to it. But it doesn\\'t bother me.- This is 4G device (there is 5G version of it, if you want it)- No wireless charging or fast charging, it takes a while to fully charge its big battery.I personally liked this phone and will recommend it.Edit-1: A week laterI discovered the main camera on the phone is defective, hoping its only the device I received. I am working with support and will update my rating and review based on final outcome.Edit-2: Seller was responsive and offered to replace phone under warranty. But I was asked to ship the phone back first, which meant I will be out of phone for few weeks. Contacted Amazon for replacement, they send me the replacement without having to return first which worked better for me. But replacement device also have same issue with its camera.CAMERA ISSUE: Main rear camera does not focus and produce blurry picture. The isdue is temporarily resolved if you lay phone flat face down and tap main camera lens several times.Both device I received have had this issue, so I am thinking this could be a defect in design and/or firmware. Otherwise phone function fine. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nÂ\\xa0I got this phone for my dad which loves to work on a lot of DIY projects. As a matter of fact this phone has a lot of tools such as bubble level, plumb bob, protractor, compass, barometer, etc.It works well on Mint mobile (which uses the T-Mobile network) using LTE frequencies. I know that someone complained that it doesn\\'t connect to the T-Mobile network but the one I got does and so far I haven\\'t noticed any issue (screenshot and video of speedtest on T-Mobile attached).Phone is also very fast thanks to the great processor and large quantity of RAM. Display is top notch and images are brilliant and sharp, even better that my other more expensive phone.My only complaint would be that the speakers are not the greatest and that it does not support the 5G network. Also, phone is somewhat bulky and heavy, but that should be expected from a rugged phone. Overall the phone works well and is fast like a flagship so I would highly recommend it. I am really liking this phone! Tough, a bit heavy and big. Battery is immense! Lasted nearly 2 days on a charge. Has 8gb ram/128gb storage with expandable memory which is sort of rare these days. Umidigi also brought back the notification LED which I missed. All in all a great cost effective rugged phone with a bunch of features. Reason i buy this phone because of the memory 256gb, and bonus the spec. this unit overall for me is very good, o hope this coming month of use o don\\'t have any problem of this unit. KudoS UMIDIGI! I have had this phone for about three days.  As implied by the title if this review, it\\'s a pretty solid piece of equipment.  Coming in at just over half a pound, you might think it chunky but is easily handled and comfortably fits in my hand.  The phone is responsive and I experience no lag with everyday usage activities.  A lot of the chunk comes from the huge battery inside and I have to say that with fairly heavy usage, I have been impressed with the stamina of the phones power source, easily handling a day of fairly heavy usage on a single power charge with about 20% to spare at days end.Although I haven\\'t put the camera to a full test, it is responsive and produces pics with good clarity and color.  I haven\\'t tried the underwater camera and quite frankly, despite the waterproof claim and the inclusion of an \"underwater camera function\", I don\\'t think I will be able to bring myself to put the bison under water on purpose.  One thing I don\\'t like is that the cameras extend out of the back of the phone just enough so that when you set your phone down on its back, it doesn\\'t sit flat but sits up on the corner where the cameras are mounted.  I like to use leveling apps and I can see this being an issue.  The g1 I am also reviewing, comes with a transparent case  which fixes this issue but the rugged gt2 doesn\\'t come with a case.  Not sure if there is cases available.I haven\\'t put an external memory card in yet but I suspect there will be no issues.  I had zero issues setting up the device with my sim card and it connected readily using 4G to my Bell service.  It has voice over data functionality which is useful when you can\\'t get a service provider signal but are able to obtain a stable wifi connection.My phone (the gray option) came with stock Android 12 which I have found to be very user friendly.  The only thing I haven\\'t been able to figure out so far is how to remove duplicate icons on the screen.Performance wise, the bison gt2 has done everything I have needed it to as fast as I want save for one slight shortcoming.  I use Deplike guitar processor app.  The latency checker in the app clocks the gt2 at between 48 ms latency with all other apps closed and 53 ms with a half dozen other apps open.  The app suggests that between 24 and 40 is good.  There is a noticeable delay between the time I pluck the string and when the sound comes out of the amp but way better than my previous higher end umidigi phones.  My work iphone (10 max) has no noticeable delay although I can\\'t check actual latency because the iphone app version dies not have a latency checker.  The clock speed of the dual core A76 processor in the gt2 is listed  2.05 GHz.  Perhaps the gt2 5g version which uses an A78 processor with 2.4 GHz speed would solve the latency issue (hoping to try one of those if I get a chance).The fingerprint sensor and face recognition work fast and flawlessly which is very handy and NFC is a must for tap and go payment and included on the device.  The two red, side mounted programmable speed buttons are definitely handy.  Wireless charging would be nice but isn\\'t available with this or any of the umidigi phones I\\'ve tried.  I have had the s3 pro, the f2, the g1 and now the bison gt2.With regards to the phone function itself, holding the phone up to the ear is fine for conversation.  With hands free using the speaker option, you have to be in a quiet environment to be able to hear.  I was iin a quiet environment and the person I was talking too had a hard time hearing me.  When I plugged in my apple headphones/earbuds into the 3.5mm port, the other person could not hear me at all.  I don\\'t know if this was because of a setting I needed to change, faulty hardware or a shortcoming of the phone design.  I did call my own number and changed my greeting using the same earbuds and while the resulting message did sound a bit muffled, it was loud enough so not sure what happened on the actual phone call. For media consumption, I find the single, back mounted speaker is a bit thin but loud enough.  I usually use a BT speaker so no issues here.This is a phone I plan on keeping.  Does most of what I need well at an awesome price point.  Eco-umidigi store have been very good and one day I hope to try the gt2 5g pro phone if it becomes available on the store.

The Umidigi Bison GT2 is a pretty decent phone for the price. It obviously does not perform like the latest and greatest flagships, but it also isn\\'t priced like one and it packs some unique features such as a large battery, ruggedized build, mostly stock Android UI, thermometer, Dual SIM, and FM radio. NFC and a high refresh rate screen are also nice to see at this price point. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack which is getting harder to find these days.Accessories included in the box are a USB-C cable and wall charger. The phone is very bulky and heavy, but the materials are good quality, and the fit and finish are quite good. The phone feels solid and appears to be rugged with additional padding on the corners to protect against drops.The screen is large, bright, and is of good quality. Touch response is ok for normal use, but probably not sensitive enough for competitive gaming although that isn\\'t really the target market for this phone. The speaker is quite loud. Haptic feedback could be stronger. Photos from the main camera are a bit soft, but it works well in well-lit environments. The two configurable hardware shortcut buttons are a nice touch.Performance is decent for the price. The processor is reasonable and the phone comes with a generous amount of RAM and storage. Battery life is impressive and should last for several days of light use.The phone received two software updates after the initial setup and, at the time of review (December 18, 2022), is running Android 12 with the April 5, 2022 security update. The software is responsive and is close to a stock Android experience. There isn\\'t really any bloatware installed, and the few apps that Umidigi included are there to take advantage of the phone\\'s unique hardware features.Overall, the Bison GT2 packs a lot of features and value for the price. If you\\'re looking for a reasonably-priced and ruggedized phone with a huge battery, it\\'s a good option.

First my confession: I have washed two phones in the washing machine and all it takes is a second or two and the phone is ruined. I did not expect to find anything bulletproof that would have a decent camera, so I set out reading about all the usual phones and only started looking at rugged models late in the search. I read something about UMIDIGI being an unusual Chinese phone manufacturer because they were building phones for construction sites, logging operations, mines and other places where work would be hard on the handheld. I read through the literature on their phones. I was literally about 50 hours into my search when I figured I could then apply one of my rules: wherever possible get the most ROM and RAM you can afford. This rule has served me well with tablets. I went with 8 gigs of ROM, 128 gigs of storage, 64 megapixels camera, and software that promised to impmrove my nighttime photos. At this stage I wasn\\'t thinking that I might find a waterproof or ruggedized camera with all that ability. I think I found it. This beast feels a bit like a brick in my hand. It weighs 290 grams, about 10 ounces. If it survives a single wash it will pay for itself instantly. I like the camera and find that it does a decent job in deep shadows and nighttime without using the flash. I am pleased with the purchase and look forward to getting to know it better. So far I have set up the facial recognition, but haven\\'t got the fingerprint working properly. I didn\\'t buy it for either of those features, so if I get them working I will consider it a bonus. i would like to throw the camera into the washing machine to see if it can survive the ordeal, but my wife won\\'t let me. 4.5. FYI, nothing tells you this: the Sim tray slides out, no sim key required. So far so good. Pleased with this purchase and the price I got it at. Home screen is more Motorola than Samsung so that way of organizing icons will take a little getting used to. Set up was easy and other than cosmetic differences, if you\\'ve run an android device/phone before, you\\'ll be able to navigate without problems. Noticeably bigger than my previous Samsung but it doesn\\'t feel wrong. Fits comfortably in the hand and the additional weight is not a problem. Feels sturdy. Nice screen. Surprisingly pleased by the sound quality and volume. Did not use the fingerprint reader as the button is small and a little awkward to get my finger positioned right to use.  I must say, coming off of 6 years of Samsung phones I do miss the ease of their streamlined add-free Samsung apps for email/gallery/video/music, but I\\'m sure after some trial and error with the app store and after playing around with the provided apps that I\\'ll find apps that work for me. Review after 2 weeks of usePros:-very sturdy phone.-has a headphone jack-phone doesn\\'t come with a lot of preinstalled bloatware-Battery life is pretty good, only had to charge it once in the 2 weeks of testing the phone with light use.-camera is good given the price range, don\\'t expect picture quality any where close to 1k$ flagship phones-Can probably run most games on the app store, I\\'ve tried genshin Impact and its playable but the framerate isn\\'t the best, prob around 20fps during action.Cons:-touch latency isn\\'t the best, if you want to game on it, especially if your into rhythm games.-phone doesn\\'t lie flat and will have a slight wobble to it due to a notch on the bottom side where the usb-c port is-speakers are at the back, so audio isn\\'t projected at you when watching videos and it can get covered if it\\'s on a surface or you are holding it in portrait mode.-gets pretty hot where the camera is when gaming on it for extended periods. I am using it to phone my contacts I bought the first one and found some debris under the screen protector film, then returned it back. With the nice email from UMIDIGI customer service, I decided to make another try. The second one I received has been working for one and half month. It\\'s really a great phone!Powerful battery can last two days even watching movies,videos. The feeling of hand holding is comfortable. The smart keys design makes it more easy when you need to run some functions more often. Multiple apps in tool box are pretty handy.I still have a lot about the phone to explore, but so far I\\'m satisfied with it. For this reason, I\\'ve bought a third one for my family.

Takes alright pictures, does not allow you to speed up videos. I do a lot of videos for my crafting so not having all the usual android options for pictures/videos kind of sucks.

This is not a premium phone by any means, camera are barely ok, bezels are giants and speed is just okay for everyday tasks. But the built quality, screen quality, battery capacity and the fact that everything is included for $270 Cdn make this a great deal for a spare phone for people like me who spend half of their lives on the road. Way better value than a A series Samsung of the same price that doesn\\'t include a case, screen protector and charger.

Used in the swimming pool a few times, definitely waterproof. Speakerphone volume is decent. Photo quality cannot be compared to expensive phones, but meets my needs. However, I love the ultra wide angle photos that\\'s not even offered in many expensive phones, I can take wide pics even at a close distance. The FM radio without headphones/cables is perfect for listening to radio without data through bluetooth earphones. Brightness is very nice that I can actually dim it to very dark for use in nighttime. Battery life is very good, can use it for 2 days straight.Everything is great for my needs, with exception of some software issues. The phone shutdown by itself a few times, and would enter a restart loop when I try to start it. After some testing, I learnt that I can break the restart loop by pressing power + volume down button for some 20 seconds.

I purchased 3 other Umidigi phones in the past and everyone I had used always had some quirks that made them hard to recommend. This phone overall is great for what it is. Battery lasts 2 days with heavy usage. Bison GT2 is speedy and performs great for all the tasks I need it to. If there would be any negatives about the product the phone itself is quite heavy based on the heavy-duty construction and the case itself is quite slippery.For a budget phone, I would strongly recommend it.  This would be a great phone for kids/teens because it can take abuse and it hits a low price point so if they do wreck it after a year you can just get them another one. ä»¥å\\x89\\x8dã\\x81®ã\\x82¹ã\\x83\\x9eã\\x83\\x9bã\\x81\\x8cæ©\\x9fè\\x83½ä¸\\x8dè¶³ã\\x81«ã\\x81ªã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x81\\x9fã\\x82\\x81è³¼å\\x85¥ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81¾ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x80\\x82å¿\\x85è¦\\x81å\\x8d\\x81å\\x88\\x86ã\\x81ªæ©\\x9fè\\x83½ã\\x81\\x8cæ\\x95´ã\\x81£ã\\x81¦ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81¦ã\\x80\\x81ä¾¡æ\\xa0¼ä»¥ä¸\\x8aã\\x81®ã\\x81\\x8aå¾\\x97æ\\x84\\x9fã\\x81\\x8cã\\x81\\x82ã\\x82\\x8aã\\x81¾ã\\x81\\x99ã\\x80\\x82é\\x9b»æº\\x90ã\\x82¹ã\\x82¤ã\\x83\\x83ã\\x83\\x81ã\\x81\\x8cæ\\x8c\\x87ç´\\x8bã\\x82»ã\\x83³ã\\x82µã\\x83¼ã\\x82\\x92å\\x85¼ã\\x81\\xadã\\x81¦ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81®ã\\x81\\x8cç\\x89¹å¾´ã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x99ã\\x80\\x82 I\\'ve had this phone for 2 weeks now. The camera is great, it\\'s got lots of storage plus a dual SIM card tray that you can have 2 Sim cards or one plus a memory card to add even more. I\\'ve dropped the phone twice and got it pretty wet once. No problem. All this for under $300. My last phone cost $1100 and I\\'m happier with my new Bison 2 Pro. So I am prone to dropping my phone and they stop working. Well I got a few weeks ago and we\\'ll luck would have it I have dropped it on the ground and in the pool and it still a live and working the same. I hope it stays that way for a few years. Robusto e bello con un software poco pratico Great phone as long as you don\\'t need to take a pic of anything. Absolutely no focus unless you use ultra wide angel, and with that setting there is no zoom etc. With video, it starts in focus and then looses it within a few seconds. Also, the watermark is turned off but then shows up in half the pics anyway. And as for 48mp on the camera, without decent software that might as well be 2mp. Such a let down. Genuinely the worst camera I have ever used , 15 years ago Samsung phones had better photos than this. Bought this phone needing a replacement for my Samsung. The phone is very nice looks good and is tough. The only thing I\\'m having issue with is the Google pay only works sporadically. Only a minor issue. Works fine, nice volume, and looks nice It is not the G95 as advertised more the G90 ...MT6785. When you look up the specs it\\'s the G90.  For the price I will keep the phone. But they should change the description at least. I had a problem and the company I purchased it from helped me greatly! Thank YOU! Been using the Bison 2 Pro for a couple of weeks now and am very happy with the way the phone has performed. Phone came almost with a full charge, inserted Sim card and it hooked up to the Telus network with no issues. Connected to the internet, phone downloaded update and installed. Has worked flawlessly since. Love the two customizable quick access buttons. To change functions go to settings and then Smart Key tab. Chose this phone for the water/dust resistant and the built in armoured case. This should eliminate the majority of phone failures, fingers crossed. The phone has handled every program and game I\\'ve needed so far. Not sure how Umidigi manufactures such a great phone at such a reasonable price point. Would not hesitate to recommend this phone to anyone that needs a great mid range phone (which are the majority of people). Final quick summary fantastic battery life, decent camera, headphone jack, handy included apps (see pic) but no added bloat ware, Android 12, lots of memory, with option of adding an SD card, and a good processor, all wrapped up in a water resistant case, at a price point that if the phone somehow breaks I won\\'t be to upset. Bought a second phone the same, now my wife and I have the same phone. Takes awesome pictures and video. ã\\x83\\xadã\\x83\\x83ã\\x82¯ç\\x94»é\\x9d¢ã\\x81§ã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x8dã\\x82\\x8bæ\\x93\\x8dä½\\x9cã\\x81\\x8cã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x8dã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x84ç\\x94»é\\x9d¢ã\\x81®æ\\x98\\x8eã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81\\x95ã\\x82\\x92ä¸\\x8bã\\x81\\x92ã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81¨å\\x8b\\x9dæ\\x89\\x8bã\\x81«æ\\x98\\x8eã\\x82\\x8bã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81ªã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x82\\x8aæ\\x9a\\x97ã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81ªã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x82\\x8aã\\x81\\x99ã\\x82\\x8bBluetoothã\\x81®é\\x9f³é\\x87\\x8fã\\x81\\x8cå¤\\x89ã\\x81\\x88ã\\x82\\x89ã\\x82\\x8cã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81ªã\\x82\\x8bã\\x82¿ã\\x83\\x83ã\\x83\\x81æ\\x84\\x9fåº¦ã\\x81\\x8cæ\\x82ªã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81¦æ\\x93\\x8dä½\\x9cã\\x81\\x8cã\\x81\\x8aã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81ªã\\x82\\x8b ã\\x81ªã\\x82\\x93ã\\x81\\x8bæ\\x99®é\\x80\\x9aã\\x81«è²·ã\\x81£ã\\x81¦è\\x89¯ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x80\\x82ã\\x80\\x82ã\\x80\\x82 Pretty good phone.

The phone is well made and works as it should.Good battery.Good camera.What I don\\'t like about it is the software. The software is very messy, maybe not made for this phone. For example, the location of the phone turns on when it wants and cannot be stopped. Overall, this is the worst software I\\'ve ever seen on a phone. It comes with screen film and case, and my dad loves it.

This phone has a ton of features not found on your \"mainstream\" phones for anywhere near the price. Underwater camera, FM radio, NFC, thermometer, 64M camera, macro camera etc..You name it this has it.It even has a dedicated button for the underwater camera so you don\\'t accidentally click somewhere else under water. I took a few pictures from underwater in the sink just to test it out and they look great.It is very responsive and everything just seems to work.The battery life is great easily lasts the whole day and sometimes a couple.Oh did I mention it is also drop resistant up to I think a meter and a half, I didn\\'t test that yet but it seems like it would take it.If you are looking for a new phone and aren\\'t afraid of trying a new brand then I would say to take a chance pick up one of these. You won\\'t be disappointed. I really like the build of the phone. It feels sturdy, has a nice screen, and is pretty snappy when it\\'s not glitching. The screen becomes unresponsive to commands throughout the day, which is really frustrating. I would have kept it if the it didn\\'t constantly glitch.

It\\'s bigger than most, corners are beefed up with quality rubber and metal encases the phone. It\\'s rugged and sturdy and beautiful all at the same time. You know this phone was built for the outdoor enthusiast!Water proof, dust proof and can last 30 minutes under water at a depth ofalmost 5 ft. It takes underwater videos and pictures with a special dedicated button on side of phone, now is that incredible or what!If you like hunting, camping, hiking,fishing, boating or just going to the beach with your kids this phone is a must.With a 64mp main camera, 24 mp selfie. You are going to get some incredible shots at the beach and in the water!This phone has so many features if you are the least bit interested go online and take in all the specs and details this Bison GT2 has to offer at an incredible price, especially for all the features that are packed into its case. Bought this for my husband who is very rough on his things.  He gets extremely frustrated with slow or sluggish running devices as well.  So far the phone has survived him using/abusing it, even at work.  I don\\'t hear him yelling at it or poking angrily at it like he did his previous phones by other brands, so I\\'m assuming that the processing speed is enough for him.  It was difficult to install the SIM card in this phone though.

It seems to be weak.It is heavy, but I guess that\\'s what you get with a beefy case and large battery. It seems to be very responsive . Its not 5G but for me that is OK. I have been nothing but very impressed with this phone. It worked great right out of the box and is better than my older Samsung. It is solid and ruggedly built, the apps work good with no locking up. Battery life is great. The camera takes good photos, perhaps not as good as phones costing 4x as much, but still good photos. Android runs very well on it and the processor is quite fast. I owned a Umidigi phone 3 years ago and was very impressed at how much their products have improved. I would definitely buy another. Just received it. Easy to set up and transfer apps and data from old cell to this one. Set up quick. Battery life incredible, solid made, little heavy but not overly difficult to use. Fast speed.  So far very good. And cost very reasonable for the capabilities of the phone. Awesome phone with tons of features.Its big and  its rugged and feels good to hold.Runs everything I want and does not skip a beat!I love the outdoors campimg and bushcraft. I still jave not dropped it off a cliff but feel goid knowing it will survie a drop in the creek.The camera is awesome and I like the analog connect for headphones. No case needed.I find the sound on the speaker a bit metalic 2 speakers would be better.Goid old fashioned phone calls are clear.Needs more colour options if you want some flavour.My favouritr phone and second from Umidigi. æ\\x9b¸ã\\x81\\x8dè¾¼ã\\x81¿ã\\x80\\x81èª\\xadã\\x81¿è¾¼ã\\x81¿é\\x80\\x9fåº¦ã\\x81¯å\\x89\\x8dä¸\\x96ä»£å\\x89\\x8dã\\x83¬ã\\x83\\x99ã\\x83«ã\\x81ªã\\x81®ã\\x81§é«\\x98ç\\x94»è³ªå\\x8b\\x95ç\\x94»ä¿\\x9då\\xad\\x98ã\\x82\\x84ã\\x80\\x81é«\\x98è§£å\\x83\\x8fåº¦ã\\x81®ã\\x82²ã\\x83¼ã\\x83\\xa0ã\\x81«ã\\x81¯å\\x90\\x91ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x84ã\\x80\\x82ç\\x94¨é\\x80\\x94ã\\x81¨ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81¦ã\\x81¯ã\\x82¢ã\\x82¦ã\\x83\\x88ã\\x83\\x89ã\\x82¢ã\\x81§ã\\x81®ä½¿ç\\x94¨ã\\x81ªã\\x82\\x89å\\x95\\x8fé¡\\x8cã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x84ã\\x82³ã\\x83³ã\\x82»ã\\x83\\x97ã\\x83\\x88ã\\x81\\x8cã\\x82¢ã\\x82¦ã\\x83\\x88ã\\x83\\x89ã\\x82¢ã\\x81£ã\\x81½ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81®ã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x9dã\\x81®é\\x80\\x9aã\\x82\\x8aã\\x81ªã\\x81®ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x82\\x82ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x82\\x8cã\\x81ªã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81\\x8cã\\x80\\x823å¹´å\\x89\\x8dè³¼å\\x85¥ã\\x81®ä»\\x96ç¤¾SIMã\\x83\\x95ã\\x83ªã\\x83¼ã\\x81®2ä¸\\x87å\\x86\\x86å\\x8f°ã\\x80\\x8164ã\\x82®ã\\x82¬(æ®\\x8bå®¹é\\x87\\x8f2ã\\x82®ã\\x82¬)ã\\x81®ã\\x82\\x82ã\\x81®ã\\x81®æ\\x96¹ã\\x81\\x8cæ\\x9b¸ã\\x81\\x8dè¾¼ã\\x81¿èª\\xadã\\x81¿è¾¼ã\\x81¿ã\\x81\\x8cæ\\x97©ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81®ã\\x81\\x8cã\\x81¡ã\\x82\\x87ã\\x81£ã\\x81¨è\\x80\\x83ã\\x81\\x88ã\\x81\\x95ã\\x81\\x9bã\\x82\\x89ã\\x82\\x8cã\\x82\\x8bã\\x80\\x82è¨\\x98æ\\x86¶å®¹é\\x87\\x8fã\\x81¯å¤§ã\\x81\\x8dã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81\\x91ã\\x81©ã\\x80\\x81ã\\x80\\x81ã\\x80\\x81 I disliked that there was the phone brand water mark on ever single picture I took.  I didnâ\\x80\\x99t investigate the phone any further after I realized this. Did not come with earphone cable other then that great phone for the price I\\'ve had the phone for almost 3 weeks now and so far so good. I like that the corners have a rubbery coating and are extra thick to protect it against falls. I like the textured back but would like greater texture for a better grip in my hand. The camera is decent for an android phone and also takes good macros. I haven\\'t tried out the underwater camera yet because it\\'s winter here. The price is amazing and unbeatable for the amount of RAM and memory that you get. My only complaint is that the phone is a little too long. Phone freezes everyday a few times a day. Just got it 5 days ago. Can\\'t accept every message like a picture text. Camera isn\\'t the best.Battery is great. Last the whole day. It does seem to take awhile to charge tho.Other than that it\\'s ok.I feel a strong current or something when I use this phone and it hurts my chest because thats where I use the phone closest. Feels like I\\'m being fried somehow thru this phone. Straight thru the nipples and sternum . If I die or get cancer soon it\\'s from this phone . I\\'d be curious to know the amount of frequency\\'s this phone emitts TÃ©lÃ©phone et internet mais souvent l\\'Ã©cran s\\'Ã©teignait soudainement et en voulant rÃ©pondre au tÃ©lÃ©phone ! if you plan to connect your phone with your Car\\'s Android Auto then this phone is not for you.If you plan to connect your phone through an HDMI connection, then this phone is not for you.If you plan to take lots of pics and vids, then this phone is not for you. Although it advertises great Megapixels, that\\'s not the only thing that makes a camera great. The processing of the camera is garbage.The temperature app , the FM radio app, the memory and the battery are the best features of the phone, but I just needed the phone to do a little more which it failed to do. Returning this phone as it didn\\'t meet my needs. I really like this phone.Pros:- Rugged. This phone feels indestructible.- Huge Battery. Lasts for days- Fingerprint reader is side-mounted. I hate in-screen fingerprint readers and much prefer the side-mounted variety.- Physical shortcut buttons. Super-convenient access to my most-used functions. I have one set for flashlight and another for the camera- Headphone jack!!- Speakers are very loudCons:- Heavy and thick. This is expected in such a rugged phone.- Slow charging. This is expected. A battery that is double the size should take twice as long to charge. Easy to setup and nice and fast..

I loved pretty much everything this UMIDIGI bison 2 pro cellphone has to offer from its durable strength,waterproof, dustproof, temperature monitor, compass and lots of ram and storage space, great value for the money. I can\\'t even begin with this trash. It was buggy from the start with the camera acting up and such and, though we contacted support, we were stalled for days until the return window closed then I get this nice email telling me that they can only offer support and will not replace the device.It was not damaged in any way and we never tried to flash a ROM or do anything outside of standard settings until they instructed us to try.Buy another phone, save yourself HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS in regret. Easy to use. Like size. Battery life great. Got the phone. Popped my sim in (koodo) , doesn\\'t show a sim is detected. Popped my buddy\\'s in (freedom mobile) same thing. Popped my mother\\'s card in , same damn thing.Contacted support. They told me the card slot was likely fried , try another sim , then set the ticket to \"resolved\"Phone is good without a card , but I WANTED A PHONE NOT A FKN TABLET.

Everything was working fine. The camera is great, the processor is very fast, watching video was no problem and the phone clarity was perfect. The rugged design is exactly as promised, quite durable.However, a few days ago, when I got up from bed, it dropped from bed, on a THICK, CARPETED floor, not even a few feet. I plugged it in, but the screen WILL NOT turn on.- rebooting, didn\\'t work.- charging all night, didn\\'t work- plugging into the computer, didn\\'t workNOTHING WORKSThe pic included is what happens when you plug it it: NOTHING.I am a fair person, so until the manufacturer honors the warranty, it\\'ll have to stay at the 1-star rating. This is only a 3 MONTH old phone, so contact me asap.'"

       "4  \\nI tried so many phones to upgrade from my oneplus 8 pro that my brother started making fun of me.I tried Sony Xperia 4, iPhone 13, galaxy s22, and oneplus 7 pro. And I didn't like ANY of them.They had better cameras for sure. Especially the iPhone was my favorite, but I hated using most of them. The s22 and pixel 7 pro were awful to hold, it felt like I held a brick all day. I use nova launcher and pie control for more efficient navigation and the pixel had issues that made it difficult to use. Oh also, the fingerprint reader was so bad and unreliable. Sony Xperia was a cool experience, but overall I didn't like it, iPhone I kept and use but just as a \"pro camera\" and s22 I returned in a heartbeat.Now, the oneplus I can't stop holding and using.

The only knock to that is the cameras take up such a big part of the phone and are pretty exposed. Kinda looks funky to me, but that's kinda how most phones are going. Because they are so exposed, they will definitely need extra protection there, which is difficult right now because the phone is so new and case choices are extremely limited or for preorder.

The phone doesn't skip a beat with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and up to a whopping 16GB RAM. Gorgeous screen with 1440p resolution and buttery 120Hz that dynamically scales down to save battery. Speaking of which, the battery experience is wonderful. I'm seeing 1.5-2 days of regular use before needing to charge back up, which takes less than 30 mins!The phone does have some shortcomings however: No wireless charging, IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0, decent cameras that are overshadowed by the competition, and finally a very...   \n",

The camera takes stunning photos, especially portraits which I take a lot of with family and pets (see example taken of my cat).

       "7  First impression is how beautiful the phone is. This was great because I'm not usually the kind of person who's big into the aesthetics. The only knock to that is the cameras take up such a big part of the phone and are pretty exposed. Kinda looks funky to me, but that's kinda how most phones are going. Because they are so exposed, they will definitely need extra protection there, which is difficult right now because the phone is so new and case choices are extremely limited or for preorder. This is also true at the moment for screen protectors.

       "8  Overall I'm loving the OnePlus 11 so far! It really feels like a flagship device, but without the ludicrous flagship price tag. It's not a perfect phone, but delivers on the aspects that matter most to me: Performance, screen quality, and battery life + charging speed. The phone doesn't skip a beat with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and up to a whopping 16GB RAM. Gorgeous screen with 1440p resolution and buttery 120Hz that dynamically scales down to save battery. Speaking of which, the battery experience is wonderful.

       "9  Love my OnePlus 11 so much!! You will not be disappointed. The haptics are amazing, the performance is fast and fluid, especially for gaming. The camera takes stunning photos, especially portraits which I take a lot of with family and pets (see example taken of my cat). Night photography really captures details and the video recording is beautiful. It doesn't get the credit it deserves in terms of camera as it revivalswhat the best phones have to offer. Yeah, no wireless charging but so what? The battery life gets you way more than through the day (I'd like to see the Pixel 7 Pro say that) and to charge the phone all the way in 25 minutes is game changing.

       "6  \\nI was nervous to buy this phone on Amazon lol, but I gave in after a week of searching between OnePlus 11,s23ultra and the pixel 7pro. I had a galaxy s10, n a OnePlus 8 I hated the s10, but loved the OnePlus 8 more than any phone I've ever had!n the only reason I kept looking at the others were the camera quality everyone raved about. But in the end I gave in n chose this phone! The camera quality isn't amazing but it's not bad either. The charge holds for at least 24hrs.i had to charge my s10 every 4-6hrs n it became a hassle!! This phone is almost perfect. No portable charging which doesn't phase me since it holds a charge for a good while and charges super fast when dead!! Only complaint is the camera is say, but it gets the job done and has edits. So I say I'm in love!!! Best Ama...   \n",
       "7  \\nFirst impression is how beautiful the phone is. This was great because I'm not usually the kind of person who's big into the aesthetics. The only knock to that is the cameras take up such a big part of the phone and are pretty exposed. Kinda looks funky to me, but that's kinda how most phones are going. Because they are so exposed, they will definitely need extra protection there, which is difficult right now because the phone is so new and case choices are extremely limited or for preorder. This is also true at the moment for screen protectors. The weight of the phone is very pleasing as well, not too heavy but feels higher quality.The phone is obviously a beast hardware-wise and the cameras are great for a general user, but are absolutely not top of the line (but close). You can al...   \n",
       "8  \\nOverall I'm loving the OnePlus 11 so far! It really feels like a flagship device, but without the ludicrous flagship price tag. It's not a perfect phone, but delivers on the aspects that matter most to me: Performance, screen quality, and battery life + charging speed. The phone doesn't skip a beat with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and up to a whopping 16GB RAM. Gorgeous screen with 1440p resolution and buttery 120Hz that dynamically scales down to save battery. Speaking of which, the battery experience is wonderful. I'm seeing 1.5-2 days of regular use before needing to charge back up, which takes less than 30 mins!The phone does have some shortcomings however: No wireless charging, IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0, decent cameras that are overshadowed by the competition, and finally a very...   \n",
       "9  \\nLove my OnePlus 11 so much!!  You will not be disappointed.  The haptics are amazing, the performance is fast and fluid, especially for gaming.  The camera takes stunning photos, especially portraits which I take a lot of with family and pets (see example taken of my cat).  Night photography really captures details and the video recording is beautiful.  It doesn't get the credit it deserves in terms of camera as it revivalswhat  the best phones have to offer.  Yeah, no wireless charging but so what?  The battery life gets you way more than through the day (I'd like to see the Pixel 7 Pro say that) and to charge the phone all the way in 25 minutes is game changing.  A lot of people also through shade at OxygenOS being ColorOS but honestly, I love it.  So many nice features and customi...   \n",

There's one issue with their phones which may lead me to buy a different brand. If you plan on using this on Verizon Wifi calling will be unavailable. Second, if you drop signal the phone doesn't automatically reconnect when you are back in the service area. You will either have to restart the phone or enter airplane mode for 8 seconds. It's annoying. If you are on any other network, I highly recommend this phone. The camera is fantastic. It's fast. The battery last all day. The 120 screen scrolls flawlessly on pages.\\n   \n",

It's not a perfect phone, but it specs deliver in the areas that matter: Excellent battery (I get 1.5 days of use before I need to charge it again) plus the charging speed is amazing, great screen quality and the performace of the processor is great. This phone with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB RAM simply rocks. Great screen resolution and smooth 120Hz that can dynamically scale down. The cameras are ok, a lot better than the ones my other phones had.

If done again I'd likely choose black over the green.I guess charging is fast.Cons:OxygenOS is clunky, feels less stock android than I'd like. Oh yes, and launcher crashes out of box not sure what that is about.Scrolling smoothness is somehow less smooth than my 4 y/o phone, not sure if it's a refresh issue but annoying no matter.Outdoor screen brightness is quite poor compared to what I had expected. Nowhere near iPhone 13 Pro, and at times seems worse again than my 4 y/o phone.Will it meet my needs? Likely. Does it meet my expectations at this level for OnePlus? Not really.\\n   \n",

The s22 and pixel 7 pro were awful to hold, it felt like I held a brick all day. I use nova launcher and pie control for more efficient navigation and the pixel had issues that made it difficult to use. Oh also, the fingerprint reader was so bad and unreliable. Sony Xperia was a cool experience, but overall I didn't like it, iPhone I kept and use but just as a \"pro camera\" and s22 I returned in a heartbeat.Now, the oneplus I can't stop holding and using.

It's not a perfect phone, but it specs deliver in the areas that matter: Excellent battery (I get 1.5 days of use before I need to charge it again) plus the charging speed is amazing, great screen quality and the performace of the processor is great. This phone with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB RAM simply rocks. Great screen resolution and smooth 120Hz that can dynamically scale down. The cameras are ok, a lot better than the ones my other phones had. Oxygen OS is ok as well, somewhat different from other experiences I've had but it's nice.The phone has some cons that to me are that important: No wireless charging (not really necessary with supervooc charging), IP64 instead of IP68, USB...   \n",

If done again I'd likely choose black over the green.I guess charging is fast.Cons:OxygenOS is clunky, feels less stock android than I'd like. Oh yes, and launcher crashes out of box not sure what that is about.Scrolling smoothness is somehow less smooth than my 4 y/o phone, not sure if it's a refresh issue but annoying no matter.Outdoor screen brightness is quite poor compared to what I had expected. Nowhere near iPhone 13 Pro, and at times seems worse again than my 4 y/o phone.Will it meet my needs? Likely. Does it meet my expectations at this level for OnePlus? Not really.\\n   \n",

       "4  \\nI tried so many phones to upgrade from my oneplus 8 pro that my brother started making fun of me.I tried Sony Xperia 4, iPhone 13, galaxy s22, and oneplus 7 pro. And I didn't like ANY of them.They had better cameras for sure. Especially the iPhone was my favorite, but I hated using most of them. The s22 and pixel 7 pro were awful to hold, it felt like I held a brick all day. I use nova launcher and pie control for more efficient navigation and the pixel had issues that made it difficult to use. Oh also, the fingerprint reader was so bad and unreliable. Sony Xperia was a cool experience, but overall I didn't like it, iPhone I kept and use but just as a \"pro camera\" and s22 I returned in a heartbeat.Now, the oneplus I can't stop holding and using.

       "6  \\nI was nervous to buy this phone on Amazon lol, but I gave in after a week of searching between OnePlus 11,s23ultra and the pixel 7pro. I had a galaxy s10, n a OnePlus 8 I hated the s10, but loved the OnePlus 8 more than any phone I've ever had!n the only reason I kept looking at the others were the camera quality everyone raved about. But in the end I gave in n chose this phone! The camera quality isn't amazing but it's not bad either. The charge holds for at least 24hrs.i had to charge my s10 every 4-6hrs n it became a hassle!! This phone is almost perfect. No portable charging which doesn't phase me since it holds a charge for a good while and charges super fast when dead!! Only complaint is the camera is say, but it gets the job done and has edits. So I say I'm in love!!! Best Ama...   \n",
       "7  \\nFirst impression is how beautiful the phone is. This was great because I'm not usually the kind of person who's big into the aesthetics. The only knock to that is the cameras take up such a big part of the phone and are pretty exposed. Kinda looks funky to me, but that's kinda how most phones are going. Because they are so exposed, they will definitely need extra protection there, which is difficult right now because the phone is so new and case choices are extremely limited or for preorder. This is also true at the moment for screen protectors. The weight of the phone is very pleasing as well, not too heavy but feels higher quality.The phone is obviously a beast hardware-wise and the cameras are great for a general user, but are absolutely not top of the line (but close). You can al...   \n",
       "8  \\nOverall I'm loving the OnePlus 11 so far! It really feels like a flagship device, but without the ludicrous flagship price tag. It's not a perfect phone, but delivers on the aspects that matter most to me: Performance, screen quality, and battery life + charging speed. The phone doesn't skip a beat with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and up to a whopping 16GB RAM. Gorgeous screen with 1440p resolution and buttery 120Hz that dynamically scales down to save battery. Speaking of which, the battery experience is wonderful. I'm seeing 1.5-2 days of regular use before needing to charge back up, which takes less than 30 mins!The phone does have some shortcomings however: No wireless charging, IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0, decent cameras that are overshadowed by the competition, and finally a very...   \n",
       "9  \\nLove my OnePlus 11 so much!!  You will not be disappointed.  The haptics are amazing, the performance is fast and fluid, especially for gaming.  The camera takes stunning photos, especially portraits which I take a lot of with family and pets (see example taken of my cat).  Night photography really captures details and the video recording is beautiful.  It doesn't get the credit it deserves in terms of camera as it revivalswhat  the best phones have to offer.  Yeah, no wireless charging but so what?  The battery life gets you way more than through the day (I'd like to see the Pixel 7 Pro say that) and to charge the phone all the way in 25 minutes is game changing.

There's one issue with their phones which may lead me to buy a different brand. If you plan on using this on Verizon Wifi calling will be unavailable. Second, if you drop signal the phone doesn't automatically reconnect when you are back in the service area. You will either have to restart the phone or enter airplane mode for 8 seconds. It's annoying. If you are on any other network, I highly recommend this phone. The camera is fantastic. It's fast. The battery last all day. The 120 screen scrolls flawlessly on pages.\\n   \n",
       "1    \\nThis is my first OnePlus phone, and dare I say this the best experience I've had with a cellphone. It's not a perfect phone, but it specs deliver in the areas that matter: Excellent battery (I get 1.5 days of use before I need to charge it again) plus the charging speed is amazing, great screen quality and the performace of the processor is great. This phone with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB RAM simply rocks. Great screen resolution and smooth 120Hz that can dynamically scale down. The cameras are ok, a lot better than the ones my other phones had. Oxygen OS is ok as well, somewhat different from other experiences I've had but it's nice.The phone has some cons that to me are that important: No wireless charging (not really necessary with supervooc charging), IP64 instead of IP68, USB...   \n",

If done again I'd likely choose black over the green.I guess charging is fast.Cons:OxygenOS is clunky, feels less stock android than I'd like. Oh yes, and launcher crashes out of box not sure what that is about.Scrolling smoothness is somehow less smooth than my 4 y/o phone, not sure if it's a refresh issue but annoying no matter.Outdoor screen brightness is quite poor compared to what I had expected. Nowhere near iPhone 13 Pro, and at times seems worse again than my 4 y/o phone.Will it meet my needs? Likely. Does it meet my expectations at this level for OnePlus? Not really.\\n   \n",

       "4    \\nI tried so many phones to upgrade from my oneplus 8 pro that my brother started making fun of me.I tried Sony Xperia 4, iPhone 13, galaxy s22, and oneplus 7 pro. And I didn't like ANY of them.They had better cameras for sure. Especially the iPhone was my favorite, but I hated using most of them. The s22 and pixel 7 pro were awful to hold, it felt like I held a brick all day. I use nova launcher and pie control for more efficient navigation and the pixel had issues that made it difficult to use. Oh also, the fingerprint reader was so bad and unreliable. Sony Xperia was a cool experience, but overall I didn't like it, iPhone I kept and use but just as a \"pro camera\" and s22 I returned in a heartbeat.Now, the oneplus I can't stop holding and using.

The camera is great, the processor is very fast, watching video was no problem and the phone clarity was perfect. The rugged design is exactly as promised, quite durable.However, a few days ago, when I got up from bed, it dropped from bed, on a THICK, CARPETED floor, not even a few feet. I plugged it in, but the screen WILL NOT turn on.- rebooting, didn't work.- charging all night, didn't work- plugging into the computer, didn't workNOTHING WORKSThe pic included is what happens when you plug it it: NOTHING.I am a fair person, so until the manufacturer honors the warranty, it'll have to stay at the 1-star rating.
